# Brand Voice

Your voice is your unfair advantage. This skill captures what makes your writing distinctly yours and ensures every piece of content maintains that sound.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Capture**: Define voice from scratch or extract from existing content
- **Apply**: Transform generic copy into your voice
- **Audit**: Check if content matches your established voice

## Voice Capture Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Voice Samples

Collect 3-5 pieces of content that best represent how you want to sound. Prioritize:
- Content you wrote yourself (not edited by others)
- Pieces you're proud of
- Writing that got strong audience response

Ask: "Share 3-5 examples of your writing that feel most like YOU."

### Step 2: Analyze Voice Dimensions

Extract patterns across four dimensions:

**Rhythm**: Sentence length patterns, paragraph structure, pacing
- Short punchy sentences vs. flowing complex ones?
- How do you open paragraphs?
- Where do you place emphasis?

**Vocabulary**: Word choices, jargon stance, formality level
- Industry terms or plain language?
- Contractions or formal?
- Specific words you gravitate toward?

**Tone**: Emotional register, attitude, energy
- Warm/distant? Serious/playful?
- Confident/tentative?
- How do you handle disagreement?

**Beliefs**: Values that show through, opinions, worldview
- What do you stand for?
- What do you push back against?
- What assumptions do you challenge?

### Step 3: Document Voice Profile

Create a voice profile with:
1. Voice summary (2-3 sentences capturing the essence)
2. Dimension details (specific patterns for each)
3. Do/Don't examples (side-by-side comparisons)
4. Signature phrases or patterns

See `references/voice-profile.md` for the full template.

### Step 4: Create Voice Tests

Build before/after examples that show transformation:
- Take generic AI output
- Show the voiced version
- Highlight what changed and why

See `references/voice-tests.md` for examples.

## Voice Application Workflow

When applying voice to any content:

### Step 1: Load Voice Profile

If a voice profile exists, read it first. Look for:
- Core voice summary
- Specific patterns to apply
- Words/phrases to use or avoid

### Step 2: Write or Transform

**If writing new content:**
- Keep voice dimensions in mind while drafting
- Match rhythm patterns (sentence/paragraph length)
- Use vocabulary from profile
- Maintain documented tone
- Let beliefs inform perspective

**If transforming existing content:**
- Identify generic patterns to replace
- Apply rhythm adjustments
- Swap vocabulary
- Adjust tone markers
- Add perspective where flat

### Step 3: Voice Check

Read aloud. Ask:
- Does this sound like the samples?
- Would the audience recognize this as [brand]?
- Are there any generic AI tells remaining?

Common AI tells to eliminate:
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- Excessive hedging ("might," "could potentially")
- Over-formal transitions
- Lists where prose would flow better

## Voice Audit Checklist

When checking if content matches voice:

1. **Rhythm match**: Compare sentence lengths to profile
2. **Vocabulary match**: Check for characteristic words
3. **Tone match**: Verify emotional register
4. **Belief match**: Confirm perspective alignment
5. **No AI tells**: Scan for generic patterns

Flag specific passages that drift from voice with recommendations.

## Integration with Other Skills

Other writing skills should:
1. Check if brand-voice profile exists
2. Load profile before writing
3. Apply voice patterns throughout
4. Run voice audit on output

This ensures consistency whether creating sales pages, emails, or social posts.

## Success Metrics

Voice is working when:
- Audience can identify your content without seeing the author
- Content feels consistent across channels
- Writing time decreases (voice becomes automatic)
- You stop editing AI output to "sound like you"
