## Voice Verification Questions

After transforming content, ask:

1. **Rhythm**: Does the sentence length pattern match the profile?
2. **Vocabulary**: Are characteristic words present? Avoided words absent?
3. **Tone**: Does the emotional register feel right?
4. **Specificity**: Have abstractions been replaced with concrete details?
5. **Personality**: Is there a clear point of view?
6. **Reader Focus**: Is it about them, not about us?
7. **Read-Aloud Test**: Does it sound like a person speaking?

If any answer is "no," revise that aspect before considering the content complete.
