# Content Repurposer

One piece becomes fifteen. Extract hooks. Transform for platforms. Maintain voice.

## Why Repurpose

Creating content is expensive. Distribution is cheap.

The math:
- 1 newsletter = 5-10 social posts
- 1 article = 1 video script + 5 social posts + 1 email
- 1 video = 10+ clips + quotes + thread

Most creators under-distribute. This skill fixes that.

## When to Use This Skill

- **After Publishing**: Turn new content into distribution
- **Content Audit**: Find gold in existing content
- **Platform Expansion**: Adapt content for new channels
- **Batch Creation**: Build week's content from one piece
- **Voice Consistency**: Maintain brand across channels

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Content Audit

Identify what to repurpose.

**High-Value Source Content:**
- Newsletter editions with high engagement
- Articles with strong traffic
- Videos with good retention
- Social posts that performed well
- Sales pages with proven hooks
- Customer conversations with insights

**Audit Questions:**
- What got the most engagement?
- What generated sales/leads?
- What got saved/shared?
- What questions did it answer?
- What hooks worked?

### Step 2: Extract Hooks

Find the reusable elements.

See `references/extraction.md` for detailed hook extraction.

**Hook Types to Extract:**

1. **Opening hooks**: First lines that grabbed attention
2. **Insight hooks**: Non-obvious points
3. **Story hooks**: Anecdotes that illustrate
4. **Data hooks**: Numbers and specifics
5. **Contrarian hooks**: Against-the-grain takes
6. **How-to hooks**: Tactical steps

**Extraction Process:**

For each source piece:
1. Identify the 3-5 strongest hooks
2. Note what makes each hook work
3. Tag by type (opening, insight, story, etc.)
4. Save to hook library for future use

### Step 3: Map Platform Transformations

Different platforms need different formats.

See `references/platform-transforms.md` for platform specs.

**Quick Platform Guide:**

| Platform | Format | Length | Tone |
|----------|--------|--------|------|
| Twitter/X | Threads, singles, lists | 280 char / 10-15 tweets | Punchy, direct |
| LinkedIn | Posts, carousels, articles | 1,300 char sweet spot | Professional insight |
| YouTube | Videos, Shorts | 8-15 min / 60 sec | Conversational |
| Instagram | Reels, carousels, stories | 15-60 sec / 10 slides | Visual, accessible |
| TikTok | Short videos | 15-60 sec | Authentic, fast |
| Podcast | Audio, clips | 20-60 min / 60-90 sec | Conversational depth |

### Step 4: Transform Content

For each platform, adapt the content.

**Transformation Principles:**

1. **Lead with the hook**: Best stuff first
2. **Match platform energy**: LinkedIn ≠ TikTok
3. **Standalone value**: Each piece works alone
4. **Native format**: Don't just copy-paste
5. **CTA appropriate**: Match platform expectations

**From Newsletter to...**

- **Thread**: Break into progressive thoughts
- **Single post**: Extract one key insight
- **Carousel**: Turn steps/points into slides
- **Video**: Use as script outline

**From Article to...**

- **LinkedIn post**: Summarize with key insight
- **Thread**: H2s become tweet topics
- **Carousel**: Listicle sections become slides
- **Video script**: Structure becomes outline
- **Email**: Tease + link

### Step 5: Maintain Voice Consistency

See `references/voice-consistency.md` for cross-platform voice.

**Voice Application:**

1. Load brand-voice profile if available
2. Adapt tone for platform (while keeping voice)
3. Check for generic AI patterns
4. Verify personality comes through

**Platform Voice Adjustments:**

- Twitter: Sharper, punchier, same voice
- LinkedIn: More context, same voice
- Video: Conversational, same voice
- Instagram: More accessible, same voice

Voice stays. Tone adapts.

## The Multiplier Framework

From one core piece, create:

```
[CORE CONTENT: Newsletter/Article/Video]
          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ IMMEDIATE (same day)                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • 1 thread (main points)                 │
│ • 3-5 single posts (individual hooks)    │
│ • 1 LinkedIn post (summary + insight)    │
│ • 1 email teaser (if driving traffic)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ EXTENDED (same week)                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • 1 carousel (steps or points)           │
│ • 1 video/reel (key concept)             │
│ • 2-3 additional single posts            │
│ • 1 quote graphic                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ EVERGREEN (ongoing library)              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • Add hooks to swipe file                │
│ • Queue for future rotation              │
│ • Combine with other content             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Integration with Other Skills

Content repurposer connects to:
- **newsletter**: Newsletters become multi-platform content
- **seo-content**: Articles become social and video
- **brand-voice**: Voice maintained across channels
- **positioning-angle**: Positioning hooks extracted and amplified

## Common Mistakes

1. **Copy-paste across platforms**: Each needs native adaptation
2. **Losing voice in transformation**: Voice should persist
3. **Forgetting the hook**: Lead with best stuff always
4. **No distribution schedule**: Content gets lost
5. **Only repurposing once**: Good content can cycle
6. **Ignoring platform norms**: Format matters
7. **No hook library**: Losing gold for future use
