# Hook Extraction

How to find the gold in existing content.

## What Makes a Hook

A hook is any element that:
- Grabs attention
- Creates curiosity
- Delivers insight
- Could stand alone
- Makes people stop scrolling

Not all content has hooks. Good content has many.

## Hook Types

### 1. Opening Hooks

First lines that grab attention immediately.

**Examples from content:**
- "Most email marketing advice is wrong."
- "I almost deleted this email. Glad I didn't."
- "The hardest part of content creation isn't creating."

**How to extract:** Look at opening sentences that create immediate engagement.

### 2. Insight Hooks

Non-obvious points that make people think.

**Examples:**
- "The best time to send emails isn't Tuesday at 10am."
- "More features = less sales."
- "Your competitors' strategy won't work for you."

**How to extract:** Find moments where you challenge assumptions or reveal something unexpected.

### 3. Story Hooks

Anecdotes that illustrate a point memorably.

**Examples:**
- "Last month, I tried an experiment..."
- "A client asked me why their landing page wasn't converting..."
- "In 2019, I made a $50,000 mistake..."

**How to extract:** Identify stories that create emotional resonance and have a clear lesson.

### 4. Data Hooks

Numbers and specifics that prove a point.

**Examples:**
- "347 customers. 94% renewal rate."
- "From 2% to 12% conversion in 3 weeks."
- "One email sequence generated $47K."

**How to extract:** Pull specific numbers, percentages, timeframes that demonstrate results.

### 5. Contrarian Hooks

Against-the-grain takes that provoke thought.

**Examples:**
- "Stop creating more content."
- "Your email list is too big."
- "Ignore best practices."

**How to extract:** Find places where you disagree with conventional wisdom.

### 6. How-To Hooks

Tactical steps people can implement.

**Examples:**
- "Here's exactly how to write a cold email that gets replies..."
- "The 3-step process for pricing your services..."
- "Copy this template..."

**How to extract:** Identify actionable, specific advice that solves a problem.

## Extraction Process

### Step 1: Read Through Content

First pass: Just consume the content without extracting.

### Step 2: Mark Potential Hooks

Second pass: Highlight anything that:
- Made you nod
- Surprised you
- Could be a social post
- Contains numbers/specifics
- Tells a story
- Challenges norms

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Hook

For each marked section, ask:
- Does this work standalone?
- Is it specific enough?
- Would I stop scrolling for this?
- What platform would this work on?

### Step 4: Categorize and Tag

Organize by hook type:
```
HOOK: "Your landing page doesn't need more copy. It needs better positioning."
TYPE: Contrarian
BEST FOR: Twitter, LinkedIn
SOURCE: [Article name]
```

### Step 5: Build Hook Library

Store hooks for future use:
- Regular rotation on social
- Email subject line inspiration
- Video hook ideas
- Ad copy starting points

## Building a Hook Library

### Organization System

```
/hooks
  /openings      (attention grabbers)
  /insights      (non-obvious points)
  /stories       (anecdotes)
  /data          (numbers and proof)
  /contrarian    (against-the-grain)
  /how-to        (tactical advice)
```

### Tagging System

Each hook tagged with:
- Source content
- Date extracted
- Platforms suited for
- Times used
- Performance (when known)

### Rotation Strategy

- Never post same hook twice in 30 days (per platform)
- Test variations of strong hooks
- Retire hooks that underperform
- Add new hooks regularly from new content
