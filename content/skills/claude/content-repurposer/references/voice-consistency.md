# Voice Consistency Across Platforms

How to maintain your brand voice while adapting to platform norms.

---

## The Core Principle

**Voice stays. Tone adapts.**

Voice = Who you are (personality, values, perspective)
Tone = How you express it in context (energy, formality)

Same person, different rooms.

## Voice Elements That Don't Change

Regardless of platform:

### 1. Vocabulary
Your characteristic words travel with you.
- Words you use
- Words you avoid
- Level of jargon

### 2. Perspective
Your point of view stays consistent.
- What you believe
- What you push back against
- How you see the world

### 3. Personality Markers
Your distinctive traits persist.
- Humor style (if any)
- Storytelling patterns
- Confidence level

### 4. Values
What you stand for shows through.
- What matters to you
- What you won't compromise
- What you champion

## Tone Elements That Adapt

### By Platform

**Twitter/X**
- Sharper, punchier
- More direct
- Fewer qualifiers
- Higher energy

**LinkedIn**
- Slightly more formal
- More context
- Professional framing
- Still personal, not corporate

**Instagram/TikTok**
- More casual
- More accessible
- Warmer energy
- Less jargon

**Long-Form (Blog/Newsletter)**
- More nuanced
- Room for complexity
- Full personality
- Natural rhythm

### Adaptation Examples

**Same message, different platforms:**

Core message: "Most email marketing advice is wrong."

**Twitter:**
"Most email marketing advice is wrong.

Here's what actually works (after 50,000 emails sent):"

**LinkedIn:**
"I've sent over 50,000 emails in my career.

And I can tell you: most of the 'best practices' you've been taught? They don't work.

Here's what I've learned..."

**Instagram carousel:**
SLIDE 1: "Stop following 'best practices'"
SLIDE 2: "After 50K emails, here's what I learned..."

**Video:**
"If you're following email marketing best practices, you're probably leaving money on the table. Let me explain..."

Same voice. Same perspective. Different packaging.

## Platform-Specific Pitfalls

### Twitter
- Getting too formal
- Losing punch in threads
- Sounding like everyone else

**Fix:** Keep it sharp. Every tweet should sound like you.

### LinkedIn
- Going corporate
- Being too safe
- Losing personality

**Fix:** Write like talking to a respected colleague, not a press release.

### Instagram
- Being too polished
- Losing authenticity
- Generic captions

**Fix:** Personality > perfection. Be human.

### Video
- Reading not talking
- Over-scripted delivery
- Losing natural rhythm

**Fix:** Script the points, not the words. Talk, don't read.

## Voice Check by Platform

Before posting, verify:

### Twitter
- [ ] Would I say this out loud?
- [ ] Does each tweet sound like me?
- [ ] Is my perspective clear?
- [ ] Have I killed generic phrases?

### LinkedIn
- [ ] Does this sound like me (not corporate)?
- [ ] Is there a clear POV?
- [ ] Am I being specific, not vague?
- [ ] Would my audience recognize my voice?

### Instagram/Video
- [ ] Is this authentically me?
- [ ] Does my personality come through?
- [ ] Am I being direct, not scripted?
- [ ] Would people who know me recognize this?

## Cross-Platform Voice Markers

Create consistent markers that travel across platforms:

### Signature Phrases
Phrases you use that become associated with you.

### Story Patterns
How you tell stories (e.g., "Last week I..." or "Here's what happened...")

### Opinion Patterns
How you disagree (e.g., "Here's the thing..." or "Unpopular opinion...")

### Teaching Patterns
How you explain (e.g., "The way I think about it..." or "Here's the mental model...")

## Maintaining Voice at Scale

When creating lots of content:

### Before Writing
- Review voice profile
- Read recent content in your voice
- Get in the headspace

### While Creating
- Check each piece against voice markers
- Read aloud
- Ask: "Would I say this?"

### After Creating
- Voice audit before posting
- Check against brand-voice profile
- Kill anything that sounds generic

### When Batching
- Do all platforms for one piece together
- Maintains voice consistency
- Adaptations feel natural

---

## Voice Drift Warning Signs

You're losing voice consistency when:

- Different platforms feel like different people
- Generic phrases creeping in
- Personality disappearing under "optimization"
- Audience engagement dropping
- You wouldn't share the content yourself
- Everything sounds like AI wrote it

**Recovery:**
1. Return to voice profile
2. Review your best content
3. Reset with one strong piece
4. Build from there

## The Brand Voice Integration

If brand-voice skill has been used:

1. **Before repurposing:** Load voice profile
2. **During transformation:** Apply voice to each platform version
3. **After creating:** Run voice consistency check
4. **Quality gate:** Don't post if voice is off

Cross-platform content should be recognizably you—just dressed appropriately for each room.
