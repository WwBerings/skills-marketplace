# Direct Response Copy

Architecture plus persuasion. The structure that guides, and the psychology that compels.

## Why This Isn't Templates

Templates give you what to write. They don't teach you why it works or how to adapt when situations change.

This skill teaches:
- **Architecture**: How to structure a page for conversion
- **Persuasion Principles**: The psychology behind why people buy
- **Section-by-Section Building**: What each part does and why

You'll understand the machine, not just operate it.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Sales Pages**: Long-form pages for courses, services, software
- **Landing Pages**: Focused pages for single offers
- **Ad Copy**: Paid traffic creative
- **Email Sales**: Promotional emails driving action
- **Launch Copy**: Time-limited promotional campaigns

## Core Architecture

Every sales page answers questions in a specific order:

```
1. What is this? → HOOK
2. Is this for me? → PROBLEM + TARGET
3. What do I get? → SOLUTION + OFFER
4. Does it work? → PROOF
5. What if it doesn't work for me? → GUARANTEE
6. What do I do now? → CTA
7. What about [objection]? → FAQ + OBJECTIONS
```

See `references/architecture.md` for detailed section breakdowns.

## The Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Strategic Inputs

Before writing a word:

**From positioning-angle skill (if available):**
- What's the differentiated hook?
- What positioning framework was used?
- Key proof points identified?

**About the Offer:**
- What are they buying exactly?
- What transformation does it enable?
- Who is this perfect for?
- Who should NOT buy this?

**About the Buyer:**
- What's their current state (pain)?
- What's their desired state (gain)?
- What have they tried before?
- What objections will they have?

### Step 2: Establish the Persuasion Strategy

Choose which principles to emphasize based on the offer and audience.

See `references/persuasion-principles.md` for the full framework.

**Quick Principle Selection:**

| Situation | Lead With |
|-----------|-----------|
| New/unknown offer | Social proof + Authority |
| Expensive offer | Value anchoring + Guarantee |
| Competitive market | Differentiation + Urgency |
| Skeptical audience | Proof stacking + Risk reversal |
| Transformational offer | Before/After + Future pacing |

### Step 3: Write Section by Section

Follow the architecture, applying principles throughout.

**Section 1: The Hook (Above the Fold)**

Job: Stop the scroll, identify the reader, promise value

Elements:
- Headline: The promise or hook
- Subhead: Clarifies/expands the headline
- Hero image/video: (optional) Shows transformation or product
- First CTA: For ready buyers

Write the headline last. Start with the problem.

**Section 2: The Problem (Agitation)**

Job: Make them feel understood, amplify the pain

Elements:
- Name the specific frustrations
- Show you understand their situation
- Agitate consequences of inaction
- Build desire for solution

**Section 3: The Solution (Introduction)**

Job: Present your thing as the answer

Elements:
- Introduce what you've created
- Connect it to the problem just described
- Preview the transformation
- Build curiosity for details

**Section 4: The Offer (What They Get)**

Job: Make the value concrete and tangible

Elements:
- Core deliverables (what's included)
- Bonuses (if any)
- Support/access details
- Format/delivery information

**Section 5: The Proof (Why Believe)**

Job: Remove doubt, build credibility

Elements:
- Results/testimonials
- Case studies
- Credentials/experience
- Specificity and evidence

**Section 6: The Guarantee (Risk Reversal)**

Job: Remove purchase fear

Elements:
- What you guarantee
- How long it lasts
- How to use it (clear process)
- Why you offer it

**Section 7: The Price + CTA**

Job: Make the exchange clear and compelling

Elements:
- Value summary/anchor
- Price reveal
- Payment options (if any)
- Clear CTA button

**Section 8: Objection Handling (FAQ)**

Job: Address remaining concerns

Elements:
- Real objections (not softball questions)
- Direct answers
- Evidence where needed

See `references/section-patterns.md` for examples of each section.

### Step 4: Apply Brand Voice

If brand-voice profile exists:
- Read the voice profile
- Pass all copy through voice filter
- Check for generic AI patterns
- Ensure personality comes through

### Step 5: Review and Refine

Checklist:
- Does the headline hook immediately?
- Is the problem section emotionally resonant?
- Is the offer crystal clear?
- Is proof specific and believable?
- Are objections actually addressed?
- Is the CTA unmissable?
- Does it sound like a human wrote it?

## Output Format

When writing sales copy, deliver:

```
## Sales Page: [Offer Name]

### Strategic Foundation
- Hook/angle: [from positioning or developed here]
- Target buyer: [who this is for]
- Primary objection: [biggest barrier to address]
- Persuasion emphasis: [which principles to lean on]

### Page Copy

[HERO SECTION]
Headline: 
Subhead: 
CTA: 

[PROBLEM SECTION]
[Copy]

[SOLUTION SECTION]  
[Copy]

[OFFER SECTION]
[Copy with deliverables]

[PROOF SECTION]
[Copy + testimonial guidance]

[GUARANTEE SECTION]
[Copy]

[PRICE + CTA SECTION]
[Copy]

[FAQ SECTION]
Q: [Objection]
A: [Answer]
```

## Integration with Other Skills

Direct response copy connects to:
- **positioning-angle**: Gets the hook and differentiation
- **brand-voice**: Applies voice to all copy
- **lead-magnet**: Same principles apply to opt-in pages
- **email-sequences**: Sales emails use these principles

## Common Mistakes

1. **Leading with features**: Lead with transformation, prove with features
2. **Weak problem section**: Not agitating enough—readers need to feel it
3. **Generic proof**: "Great course!" isn't proof. Specificity is.
4. **Burying the CTA**: Should be unmissable and repeated
5. **Template voice**: Copy should sound like a person, not a formula
6. **No objection handling**: Unaddressed objections kill sales
7. **Skipping the guarantee**: Risk reversal is powerful—use it
