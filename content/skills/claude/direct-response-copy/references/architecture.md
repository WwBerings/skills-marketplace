# Sales Page Architecture

The structure that guides buyers from curiosity to conversion.

---

## The Reader's Journey

Every sales page takes readers through a psychological journey:

```
ATTENTION   → "This looks interesting"
INTEREST    → "This might be for me"
DESIRE      → "I want this"
CONVICTION  → "I believe it works"
ACTION      → "I'm buying this"
```

Your architecture maps to this journey.

## Section-by-Section Architecture

### Section 1: The Hook (ATTENTION)

**Location:** Above the fold (what they see before scrolling)
**Length:** Brief—headline, subhead, maybe 1-2 sentences
**Time spent:** 3-8 seconds to decide if they keep reading

**Job:** Stop the scroll, qualify the reader, promise value

**Essential Elements:**
- **Headline**: The hook—specific promise or compelling question
- **Subhead**: Clarifies headline, adds context
- **Quick qualifier**: Who this is for
- **First CTA**: For ready buyers (some are ready immediately)

**Architecture Options:**

Option A: Promise-led
```
[Headline: Specific promise/outcome]
[Subhead: For who + how/what]
[CTA]
```

Option B: Question-led
```
[Headline: Question that triggers YES]
[Subhead: What you'll discover/get]
[CTA]
```

Option C: Story-led
```
[Headline: Intriguing hook]
[Subhead: Payoff preview]
[CTA]
```

### Section 2: The Problem (INTEREST)

**Location:** Immediately after hook
**Length:** 200-500 words typically
**Job:** Make them feel understood, amplify the pain

**Essential Elements:**
- **Current state description**: Where they are now
- **Frustration naming**: Specific pains they recognize
- **Failed attempt acknowledgment**: What they've tried
- **Cost of inaction**: What happens if nothing changes

**Architecture:**

```
[Open with empathy—show you get their situation]

- Frustration 1
- Frustration 2
- Frustration 3

[Acknowledge what they've tried]

[Agitate consequences]

[Transition to hope]
```

**Key Principle:** Don't rush this section. The problem needs to land emotionally before the solution is introduced.

### Section 3: The Solution (INTEREST → DESIRE)

**Location:** After problem is established
**Length:** 150-300 words for introduction
