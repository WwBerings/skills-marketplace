The psychology of why people say yes. Apply throughout your copy.

## The Core Principles

### 1. Pain vs. Gain

**Principle:** People are more motivated to avoid pain than to pursue pleasure.

**Application:**
- Lead with problems, not features
- Quantify the cost of inaction
- Paint the painful status quo
- Make the current situation feel unacceptable

**In copy:**
- Problem section comes before solution
- "Stop losing..." often outperforms "Start winning..."
- Agitation is necessary, not manipulation

**Example:**
❌ "Learn marketing strategies"
✅ "Stop watching competitors steal your customers"

---

### 2. Specificity = Believability

**Principle:** Specific claims are inherently more credible than vague ones.

**Application:**
- Use exact numbers over ranges
- Name specific results over general improvements
- Describe precise processes over abstract benefits
- Include verifiable details

**In copy:**
- "$47,382" beats "almost $50K"
- "14 days" beats "about two weeks"
- "3-step process" beats "simple method"

**Example:**
❌ "Many students have seen great results"
✅ "347 students have completed the program. Average revenue increase: 43%"

### 3. Social Proof

**Principle:** People look to others' actions to determine their own.

**Application:**
- Show others have purchased/benefited
- Use testimonials strategically
- Display numbers (students, customers, downloads)
- Reference recognizable names/logos

**Proof Hierarchy (strongest to weakest):**
1. Results with specific numbers
2. Video testimonials
3. Written testimonials with photos
4. Logos/company names
5. Number of customers/users
6. Media mentions

**In copy:**
- Place proof after claims that need support
- Make testimonials specific, not generic
- Use proof that matches the claim

---

### 4. Authority

**Principle:** People defer to experts and credible sources.

**Application:**
- Establish your credentials early
- Cite sources and data
- Show experience/track record
- Borrow authority (endorsements, features)

**Authority Types:**
- Expertise: Knowledge, skills, training
- Experience: Years, projects, outcomes
- Recognition: Awards, media, affiliations
- Results: What you've achieved

**In copy:**
- Weave authority naturally (don't brag)
- Let results speak for expertise
- Third-party validation > self-claim

---

### 5. Reciprocity

**Principle:** People feel obligated to return favors.

**Application:**
- Lead with value (free content)
- Provide unexpected bonuses
- Over-deliver on expectations
- Give before asking

**In copy:**
- Lead magnets before sales
- Generous content in sales page
- Surprise bonuses in offer stack

---

### 6. Scarcity

**Principle:** People want what's limited or might disappear.

**Application:**
- Genuine limitations (seats, time, inventory)
- Deadlines that are real
- Consequences of missing out
- Early-bird advantages

**Scarcity Types:**
- Time: Deadline-based
- Quantity: Limited availability
- Access: Exclusive/early
- Bonus: Expires separately

**Warning:** Fake scarcity destroys trust. Only use real limitations.

---

### 7. Commitment & Consistency

**Principle:** People want to act consistently with prior commitments.

**Application:**
- Get small yeses before big ask
- Remind them of previous actions
- Show how purchase aligns with their values
- Use questions they'll answer "yes" to

**In copy:**
- "You already know [X]... "
- "If you're the kind of person who..."
- Micro-commitments throughout (read more, watch video)

---

### 8. Future Pacing

**Principle:** Help them vividly imagine life after purchasing.

**Application:**
- Paint the after state in detail
- Use present tense for future outcomes
- Engage multiple senses
- Connect to their specific situation

**In copy:**
- "Imagine waking up to..."
- "Picture yourself..."
- "Three months from now, you'll..."

---

### 9. Risk Reversal

**Principle:** Removing risk makes saying yes easier.

**Application:**
- Strong guarantees
- Clear return policies
- Trial periods
- Results-based promises

**Guarantee Types:**
- Money-back (basic)
- Extended money-back (better)
- Results guarantee (strongest)
- Keep the bonuses (reduces regret)

**In copy:**
- Place guarantee near price
- Make claiming easy
- Show confidence in product

---

### 10. Anchoring

**Principle:** First number seen becomes reference point for comparison.

**Application:**
- Present higher value first
- Show competitor prices
- Break down cost-per-day
- Stack total value

**In copy:**
- "Worth $5,000... yours for $997"
- "Less than your daily coffee"
- "Cheaper than [worse alternative]"

## Ethical Application

These principles describe how humans naturally make decisions. They're not manipulation tricks—they're communication tools.

**Ethical use:**
- Product genuinely delivers value
- Claims are truthful and provable
- Scarcity is real, not manufactured
- Helping people make good decisions

**Manipulation:**
- Product doesn't deliver
- False or exaggerated claims
- Fake limitations
- Pressuring into bad decisions

The goal: Help the right people say yes to something that helps them.
