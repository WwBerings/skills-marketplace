## Problem Section Patterns

### Pattern: Frustration Cascade

```
You've tried everything...

- You've [common attempt #1], but [result/frustration]
- You've [common attempt #2], but [still stuck]
- You've [common attempt #3], and yet [nothing changes]

Meanwhile, [what's happening]...

[Specific frustration] is costing you [specific cost].

Every day you [don't solve this], you're [losing/missing/struggling with]...

And the worst part? [Deeper insight into the real problem]

It's not your fault. [Empathy + reframe]

The problem isn't [what they think]—it's [actual problem].
```

**Example:**
```
You've tried everything...

- You've written blog posts, but they get 50 views and disappear
- You've posted on social media, but the algorithm ignores you
- You've "been consistent," and yet your list stays stuck at 200

Meanwhile, creators who started after you are landing podcast features and getting sponsorship deals...

Every week you don't grow your audience, you're leaving money on the table.

And the worst part? You're doing what the "experts" said to do.

It's not your fault. You followed the advice.

The problem isn't your content—it's your distribution. And nobody talks about that part.
```

## Solution Section Patterns

### Pattern: Bridge

```
What if there was a way to [achieve desired outcome] without [pain/obstacle]?

That's exactly why I created [Product Name].

[Product Name] is [what it is in one sentence].

Unlike [alternatives], this [key differentiator].

Here's how it works:

[Brief mechanism—3-4 sentences max]

The result? [Transformation statement]

Let me show you everything you get inside...
```

**Example:**
```
What if there was a way to grow your email list without spending 4 hours a day on content?

That's exactly why I created The List Engine.

The List Engine is a complete system for turning one piece of weekly content into consistent subscriber growth.

Unlike "just be consistent" advice, this focuses on distribution and conversion—the parts that actually matter.

Here's how it works: You create one core piece per week. The system shows you how to distribute it across 7 channels and optimize your opt-in pages for conversion.

The result? Predictable list growth with dramatically less content creation.

Let me show you everything you get inside...

---

[Repeat 3-5 times with variety]

### Pattern: Confident Guarantee

```
## My [X-Day] 100% Money-Back Guarantee
