## Preview Text

**Principles:**

Preview: "But then I read the third paragraph..."

Subject: "Why your landing page isn't converting"
Preview: "It's not the headline. It's this."

**Story Start:**

**Observation:**

```

## Call to Action

**Purpose:** Get the click/response/action

**Location:** End of email (and sometimes middle for long emails)

**Principles:**

```

**Reply CTA:**

### CTA Best Practices

- Specific about what happens
- Creates low friction
- Matches email content

**Strong CTAs:**
- "Get the 3-step template"
- "Watch the 12-minute training"
- "Save your seat for Thursday"

**Weak CTAs:**
- "Click here"
- "Learn more"
- "Submit"

## P.S. Section

**Purpose:** Catch skimmers, add urgency, or plant seed

**Usage:** Optional but powerful

**Why It Works:** People often read subject, skim to end, then decide to read

### P.S. Uses

**Urgency:**
"P.S. Early bird pricing ends Friday. After that, it's $200 more."

**Social Proof:**
"P.S. 347 people have already joined. You coming?"

**Bonus:**
"P.S. Reply to this email and I'll send you the bonus template."

**Reminder:**
"P.S. Don't forget to [action] before [deadline]."

**Tease:**
"P.S. Tomorrow I'm sharing [interesting thing]. Watch your inbox."
