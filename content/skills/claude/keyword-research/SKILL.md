# Keyword Research

The 6 Circles Method for finding what to write about—and knowing which topics deserve your time first.

## Why This Matters

Most people skip keyword research because:
- Tools are expensive
- The process feels overwhelming
- They don't know what to do with the data

This skill gives you a methodology that works with free tools and produces prioritized topic lists you can actually execute.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Content Planning**: Building a content calendar from scratch
- **Topic Validation**: Checking if an idea is worth pursuing
- **Gap Analysis**: Finding topics competitors miss
- **Opportunity Hunting**: Looking for low-competition wins
- **Quarterly Planning**: Refreshing your content strategy

## The 6 Circles Method

Six overlapping circles create your topic universe. The sweet spot is where multiple circles overlap.

```
    [Expertise]     [Audience Pain]     [Search Volume]
         \              |               /
          \             |              /
           \            |             /
            [   SWEET   SPOT   ]
           /            |             \
          /             |              \
         /              |               \
    [Competition]   [Business Value]   [Content Gap]
```

See `references/6-circles.md` for the complete methodology.

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Circles

**Circle 1 - Expertise**: What do you know deeply?
- Topics you can speak on without research
- Areas where you have unique experience
- Subjects where you have strong opinions

**Circle 2 - Audience Pain**: What keeps them up at night?
- Problems they're actively trying to solve
- Questions they're asking in communities
- Frustrations with current solutions

**Circle 3 - Search Volume**: Are people actually searching?
- Use free tools to estimate demand
- Look for consistent search interest
- Balance volume with specificity

**Circle 4 - Competition**: Can you rank?
- Who's currently ranking for this?
- What's the quality of existing content?
- Where are there gaps or weaknesses?

**Circle 5 - Business Value**: Does this lead to revenue?
- How close is this to purchase intent?
- Can you naturally mention your offer?
- Does it attract your ideal customer?

**Circle 6 - Content Gap**: Is there room for your take?
- What angle isn't being covered?
- What's outdated in existing content?
- What can you add that others can't?

### Step 2: Generate Topic Seeds

Start with three seed sources:

**Source 1: Your Brain**
- What questions do customers ask?
- What do you find yourself explaining repeatedly?
- What would you write if SEO didn't exist?

**Source 2: Audience Research**
- Reddit threads in your space
- Twitter/LinkedIn discussions
- Customer support tickets
- Sales call notes

**Source 3: Competitor Content**
- What's their most-shared content?
- What topics do they keep returning to?
- What are they NOT covering?

### Step 3: Expand Keywords (Free Tools)

For each seed topic, expand using:

**Google Autocomplete**
- Type seed + letter (a, b, c...) 
- Note suggested completions
- These are real searches

**People Also Ask**
- Search your seed topic
- Capture all PAA questions
- Click to expand more

**Google Related Searches**
- Bottom of search results
- Shows connected topics
- Often reveals angles

**AnswerThePublic** (limited free)
- Visual keyword expansion
- Question-based queries
- Preposition variations

**AlsoAsked** (limited free)
- PAA question trees
- Shows question relationships
- Great for content clusters

### Step 4: Score Each Topic

Rate each topic 1-3 on all six circles:

| Topic | Expertise | Pain | Volume | Competition | Value | Gap | TOTAL |
|-------|-----------|------|--------|-------------|-------|-----|-------|
| Topic A | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 15 |
| Topic B | 2 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 13 |

**Scoring Guide:**
- 3 = Strong (definitely yes)
- 2 = Moderate (somewhat)
- 1 = Weak (barely)

### Step 5: Prioritize for Execution

Sort by total score, then apply filters:

**Quick Wins First** (high score + low competition)
- Can rank faster
- Build momentum
- Prove the process

**Pillar Content** (high score + high volume)
- Takes longer to rank
- Worth the investment
- Supports clusters

**Skip For Now** (low business value regardless of volume)
- Traffic without revenue
- Time better spent elsewhere

See `references/prioritization.md` for the prioritization framework.

## Output Format

After running the 6 Circles analysis, deliver:

```
## Keyword Research: [Topic Area]

### Seeds Explored
[List of seed topics analyzed]

### Top Opportunities (Prioritized)

**Tier 1: Quick Wins** (target first)
| Topic | Score | Est. Volume | Competition | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| [Topic] | [X/18] | [range] | [low/med] | [angle] |

**Tier 2: Strategic Plays** (worth investment)
| Topic | Score | Est. Volume | Competition | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|-------|

**Tier 3: Consider Later**
[Topics that score well but have timing/resource constraints]

### Recommended Content Plan
- Month 1: [Quick wins to target]
- Month 2-3: [Build on wins, start pillars]
- Ongoing: [Cluster expansion]

### Topics to Skip
[What scored low and why]
```

## Integration with Other Skills

Keyword research feeds into:
- **seo-content**: Keywords become content briefs
- **newsletter**: Topics inform newsletter themes
- **content-repurposer**: Keyword data guides platform focus
- **lead-magnet**: High-intent keywords suggest magnet topics

## Common Mistakes

1. **Chasing volume only**: High traffic ≠ right traffic
2. **Ignoring competition**: Can't rank = waste of effort
3. **Skipping business value**: Traffic without revenue intent
4. **Analysis paralysis**: Research endlessly, write nothing
5. **One-time exercise**: Should revisit quarterly
