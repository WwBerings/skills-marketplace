# The 6 Circles Method

Complete methodology for finding and validating content topics.

---

## Overview

The 6 Circles represent different lenses for evaluating content topics. No single circle is sufficient—the magic happens at intersections.

```
Perfect Topic = Expertise ∩ Audience Pain ∩ Search Volume ∩ Low Competition ∩ Business Value ∩ Content Gap
```

In reality, you rarely get all six. Aim for 4+ strong circles.

## Circle 1: Expertise

### What It Means
Topics where you have genuine knowledge, experience, or unique perspective.

### Why It Matters
- Authentic content outperforms researched-but-shallow
- You can go deeper than surface-level guides
- Credibility shows in the writing
- Faster to create (less research needed)

### How to Assess
Ask yourself:
- Could I talk about this for 30 minutes without notes?
- Do I have personal experience or case studies?
- Have I solved this problem for clients/customers?
- Do I have opinions that differ from mainstream?

### Scoring
- **3**: Deep expertise, unique experience, strong opinions
- **2**: Familiar territory, could learn gaps quickly
- **1**: Would need significant research to write credibly

### Questions to Surface Expertise Topics
- What do people ask you about repeatedly?
- What have you figured out that others still struggle with?
- What mistakes have you made that you can teach from?
- What industry "best practices" do you disagree with?

## Circle 2: Audience Pain

### What It Means
Topics that address real problems your target audience is experiencing.

### Why It Matters
- Pain-driven content gets attention
- Solves real problems = builds trust
- More likely to be searched for
- Natural connection to your offer

### How to Assess
- Are people actively seeking solutions?
- Is this a must-solve or nice-to-solve problem?
- How urgent is the pain?
- How aware are they that they have this problem?

### Scoring
- **3**: Urgent, actively seeking solutions, aware of problem
- **2**: Moderate pain, aware but not urgent
- **1**: Mild frustration, or unaware they have the problem

### Research Sources for Audience Pain
- **Reddit**: Search "[your industry] + frustrated/help/problem"
- **Twitter/X**: Search questions in your space
- **Amazon reviews**: Of competitors or related products
- **Sales calls**: What objections or questions come up?
- **Support tickets**: What do customers ask for help with?

## Circle 3: Search Volume

### What It Means  
Are enough people actually searching for this topic?

### Why It Matters
- No searches = no organic traffic potential
- Validates that people want this information
- Helps prioritize where to invest

### How to Assess (Free Methods)

**Google Keyword Planner** (free with Google Ads account)
- Shows monthly search ranges
- Best for ballpark estimates

**Google Trends**
- Shows relative interest over time
- Compare topics against each other
- Spot seasonal patterns

**Autocomplete Analysis**
- More suggestions = more searches
- Specific suggestions = specific searches

**SERP Analysis**
- Lots of ads = commercial value
- Featured snippets = informational demand

### Scoring
- **3**: Clear search demand (1,000+ monthly), consistent interest
- **2**: Moderate search (100-1,000), or niche but dedicated audience
- **1**: Minimal search (<100), or very new topic

### Volume Considerations
- Low volume + high intent often beats high volume + low intent
- Niche topics can still be valuable if audience converts well
- Don't dismiss topics just because volume seems "low"

## Circle 4: Competition

### What It Means
Can you realistically rank for this topic given who's already ranking?

### Why It Matters
- Competing with Wikipedia/HubSpot/etc. is hard
- Low competition = faster wins
- Understanding competition reveals angles

### How to Assess

**Check current SERPs:**
- Who's ranking on page 1?
- Are they major brands or independents?
- How good is their content actually?

**Content quality audit:**
- Is the content comprehensive or shallow?
- Is it recent or outdated?
- Does it actually answer the query?

**Domain authority quick check:**
- Are top results from high-authority sites?
- Any small sites ranking? (good sign)

### Scoring
- **3**: Mostly weak content, small sites ranking, clear gaps
- **2**: Mixed—some strong, some weak content
- **1**: Dominated by major brands with comprehensive content

### Competition Sweet Spots
- Old content that hasn't been updated
- Big brands with generic content (you can be more specific)
- Questions with thin or off-topic results
- Topics where you have unique authority

---

## Circle 5: Business Value

### What It Means
Does this topic lead people toward becoming customers?

### Why It Matters
- Traffic without revenue is a vanity metric
- Some topics attract buyers, others attract browsers
- Content should connect to your offer

### How to Assess

**Intent spectrum:**
```
Awareness → Interest → Consideration → Decision
(lower value) -----------------------> (higher value)
```

**Proximity to offer:**
- How natural is mentioning your product/service?
- Does this attract ideal customers or random traffic?
- Would readers be qualified leads?

### Scoring
- **3**: Decision-stage, high-intent, ideal customer, natural offer fit
- **2**: Consideration-stage, qualified audience, can connect to offer
- **1**: Awareness-stage, broad audience, weak offer connection

### Business Value Examples

**High Value (3):**
- "[Your category] comparison"
- "How to [solve problem your product solves]"
- "[Competitor] alternatives"

**Medium Value (2):**
- "[Industry] best practices"
- "How to [related skill]"
- "[Problem] guide"

**Lower Value (1):**
- "[Industry] trends"
- "[Broad concept] explained"
- Historical/news content

## Circle 6: Content Gap

### What It Means
Is there room for your unique take, or is the topic exhaustively covered?

### Why It Matters
- Me-too content rarely wins
- Gaps are opportunities
- Your angle matters as much as the topic

### How to Assess

**Gap types to look for:**

1. **Freshness gap**: Content is outdated
2. **Depth gap**: Existing content is surface-level
3. **Angle gap**: Different perspective not covered
4. **Format gap**: No video/visual/tool where it would help
5. **Audience gap**: Content serves different audience than yours
6. **Experience gap**: Theory but no practical experience

### Scoring
- **3**: Clear gap you can fill, unique angle available
- **2**: Some differentiation possible with effort
- **1**: Topic well-covered from all angles

### Finding Your Gap

Ask:
- What can I add from personal experience?
- What are existing articles missing?
- What would I want to know that they don't cover?
- What contrarian take do I have?
- What more specific angle serves my audience better?

## Putting It Together

### The Scoring Matrix

For each topic candidate, score 1-3 on each circle:

| Circle | Topic A | Topic B | Topic C |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Expertise | 3 | 2 | 3 |
| Audience Pain | 3 | 3 | 2 |
| Search Volume | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| Competition | 2 | 1 | 3 |
| Business Value | 3 | 2 | 2 |
| Content Gap | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| **TOTAL** | **15** | **13** | **15** |

### Interpretation

**15-18**: Strong candidate, prioritize
**12-14**: Good candidate, consider context
**9-11**: Weak candidate, needs compelling reason
**Below 9**: Skip unless strategic necessity

### Circle Trade-offs

Some acceptable trade-offs:
- Lower volume + higher business value = worth it for B2B
- Lower expertise + hire expert contributor = can work
- Higher competition + unique angle = can still win

Unacceptable trade-offs:
- Zero business value (regardless of other scores)
- Zero expertise + zero content gap = why bother?
- High competition + no differentiation = wasted effort
