## The Priority Matrix

After scoring topics with the 6 Circles, sort them into quadrants:

```
                    HIGH BUSINESS VALUE
                           │
        ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
        │                  │                  │
        │   STRATEGIC      │   QUICK WINS     │
        │   PILLARS        │                  │
        │                  │                  │
HIGH    │  Worth major     │  Do these first  │
EFFORT  │  investment      │  Fast ROI        │
        │                  │                  │
────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┼────────
        │                  │                  │
        │   SKIP           │   OPPORTUNISTIC  │
        │                  │                  │
LOW     │  Time sink       │  Only if easy    │
EFFORT  │  Little return   │  Don't over-     │
        │                  │  invest          │
        │                  │                  │
        └──────────────────┼──────────────────┘
                           │
                    LOW BUSINESS VALUE
```

## Content Clusters

Group related topics into clusters around pillar content:

```
                    [Pillar Article]
                    Main comprehensive guide
                           │
        ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
        │                  │                  │
   [Cluster 1]       [Cluster 2]       [Cluster 3]
   Related topic     Related topic     Related topic
        │                  │                  │
        └──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
                           │
              All interlink to pillar
```

**Cluster Benefits:**
- Topical authority signals to Google
- Internal linking strengthens all pages
- Comprehensive coverage attracts links
- User finds everything they need

**Cluster Planning:**
1. Identify pillar topic (broad, high-volume)
2. Find supporting topics (specific, long-tail)
3. Map internal links before writing
4. Publish cluster within 2-3 months

## Decision Filters

Use these questions to break ties between similar-scoring topics:

### Filter 1: Timing
- Is this topic trending or emerging?
- Is it seasonal? (plan accordingly)
- Will waiting cost the opportunity?

### Filter 2: Assets
- Do I already have case studies/data for this?
- Can I include proprietary information?
- Do I have images/templates to include?

### Filter 3: Distribution
- Can I easily share this with my audience?
- Will it work in email/social?
- Can others easily share it?

### Filter 4: Updates
- Will this need frequent updates?
- Is the topic evergreen or time-bound?
- Can I maintain this long-term?

## The 80/20 Approach

Not all topics need full treatment:

**Full Article (80% effort):**
- Strategic Pillars
- High business value + high volume
- Core topics in your expertise

**Quick Article (20% effort):**
- Quick Wins with lower competition
- Supporting cluster content
- Trending/timely topics

**Content Formats by Effort:**

| Effort Level | Word Count | Production Time | Use For |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|---------|
| Full | 2,500+ | 8-16 hours | Pillars |
| Standard | 1,500-2,500 | 4-8 hours | Most topics |
| Quick | 800-1,500 | 2-4 hours | Low-competition wins |
| Snippet | 500-800 | 1-2 hours | Cluster support |

## Tracking Progress

### Monthly Review Questions

1. Which topics ranked fastest?
2. Which are stuck? Why?
3. What does traffic data show?
4. Should priorities shift?
5. What new opportunities emerged?

### Success Signals

**Good signs:**
- Quick Wins ranking within 4-8 weeks

- Content generating leads/conversions

**Warning signs:**
- No movement after 3+ months

## Priority Recalibration

Revisit priorities when:

- **Business pivot**: Offer or audience changed
- **Seasonal shift**: Different topics more relevant
- **6 months elapsed**: Regular refresh of research
