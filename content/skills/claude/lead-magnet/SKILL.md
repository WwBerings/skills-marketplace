# Lead Magnet V2

Your free thing should do real work. Create opt-in offers that attract the right people.

## Why Most Lead Magnets Fail

1. **Weak hook**: Not compelling enough
2. **Wrong format**: Doesn't match audience needs
3. **No validation**: Built on assumption

## Required Inputs

Before creating opt-in page copy, collect:

```
"Voordat ik de opt-in pagina schrijf, heb ik URLs nodig:

1. Download/thank you pagina: ___
2. Gerelateerde content/blog: ___
3. Product/service pagina (voor de 'next step'): ___

Welke URLs kan ik gebruiken?"
```

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Define Target Subscriber

Questions to answer:
- Who is the ideal person for your list?
- What problem are they actively solving?
- What have they already tried?
- What would make them immediately interested?

### Step 2: Surface the Hook

Hook must be:
- **Specific**: Solves particular problem
- **Immediate**: Delivers value quickly
- **Desirable**: Something they actually want
- **Credible**: Believable you can deliver

See `references/hooks.md` for formulas.

**Hook Types:**
1. Speed Hook: Get [result] in [short time]
2. Ease Hook: The simple way to [outcome]
3. Secret Hook: The [hidden method] for [result]
4. Mistake Hook: Avoid these [X] costly errors
5. Template Hook: Copy my [template] for [result]
6. Checklist Hook: Everything you need to [goal]

### Step 3: Select Format

See `references/formats.md` for details.

| If they need... | Use format... |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Learn a process | Checklist or Guide |
| Save time | Template or Swipe File |
| Make decisions | Calculator or Assessment |
| Understand concepts | Video or Mini-Course |
| Quick reference | Cheat Sheet |

### Step 4: Validate Before Building

Don't spend 20 hours on something nobody wants.

**Validation Methods:**
- Audience poll
- Content performance data
- Search data
- Competitor analysis
- Minimum viable test

### Step 5: Create Lead Magnet

**Structure:**
1. Immediate value first
2. Quick wins early
3. Clear next steps
4. Natural bridge to offer

### Step 6: Write Opt-in Page

**Elements:**
- Headline: The hook, crystallized
- Subhead: What they'll get/achieve
- Bullet points: 3-5 specific benefits
- Social proof: downloads, testimonials [with claim labels]
- Simple form: Email only
- CTA button: Action-oriented (not "Submit")

## Claim Labeling (B2B Requirement)

Label proof points on opt-in page:

- `[BRON: {source}]` - Verified stat or testimonial
- `[SCHATTING]` - Estimated number
- `[VERIFICATIE NODIG]` - Needs verification

**Examples:**
- "500+ downloads [SCHATTING]"
- "Gemiddeld 3 uur tijdsbesparing [BRON: gebruikersonderzoek]"
