# Lead Magnet

Your free thing should do real work. This skill helps you create opt-in offers that attract the right people and make them excited to hear from you.

## Why Most Lead Magnets Fail

Three reasons:
1. **Weak hook**: Not compelling enough to trade an email for
2. **Wrong format**: Doesn't match what the audience actually wants
3. **No validation**: Built on assumption, not evidence

This skill fixes all three.

## When to Use This Skill

- **List Building**: Need to grow email subscribers
- **Launch Prep**: Building audience for upcoming offer
- **Funnel Entry**: Creating top-of-funnel asset
- **Lead Quality**: Current leads aren't converting
- **Content Upgrade**: Adding opt-ins to existing content

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Target Subscriber

Before creating anything, get specific about who you're attracting.

**Questions to answer:**
- Who is the ideal person to have on your list?
- What problem are they actively trying to solve?
- What do they believe about solutions to that problem?
- What have they already tried that didn't work?
- What would make them immediately interested?

**Warning signs of wrong targeting:**
- "Everyone" could use this
- No clear connection to your paid offer
- Attracts browsers, not buyers

### Step 2: Surface the Hook

The hook is why someone trades their email. It must be:
- **Specific**: Solves a particular problem
- **Immediate**: Delivers value quickly
- **Desirable**: Something they actually want
- **Credible**: Believable that you can deliver

See `references/hooks.md` for hook formulas and examples.

**Hook Types:**

1. **Speed Hook**: Get [result] in [short time]
2. **Ease Hook**: The simple way to [desired outcome]
3. **Secret Hook**: The [hidden method] for [result]
4. **Mistake Hook**: Avoid these [X] costly errors
5. **Checklist Hook**: Everything you need to [achieve goal]
6. **Template Hook**: Copy my [proven template] for [result]
7. **Case Study Hook**: How [person] achieved [specific result]
8. **Tool Hook**: The [free tool] that [delivers benefit]

### Step 3: Select Format

Match format to hook and audience. Not every lead magnet needs to be an ebook.

See `references/formats.md` for format details.

**Quick Format Selection:**

| If they need... | Use this format |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| To learn a process | Checklist or Guide |
| To save time | Template or Swipe File |
| To make decisions | Calculator or Assessment |
| To understand concepts | Video or Mini-Course |
| Quick reference | Cheat Sheet |
| Ongoing help | Tool or Resource Library |

**Format Effort Matrix:**

| Format | Creation Time | Perceived Value | Best For |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Checklist | 2-4 hours | Medium | Process-oriented people |
| Template | 4-8 hours | High | DIYers who want shortcuts |
| Guide/Ebook | 8-20 hours | Medium-High | Comprehensive solutions |
| Calculator | 8-16 hours | Very High | Data-driven decisions |
| Mini-Course | 10-30 hours | Very High | Complex topics |
| Cheat Sheet | 1-2 hours | Medium | Quick reference needs |
| Swipe File | 4-8 hours | High | Creative inspiration |
| Assessment | 8-20 hours | Very High | Self-discovery |

### Step 4: Validate Before Building

Don't spend 20 hours on something nobody wants.

**Validation Methods:**

1. **Audience Poll**: Ask directly what they'd find most useful
2. **Content Performance**: Which blog posts get most engagement?
3. **Search Data**: Are people searching for this topic?
4. **Competitor Analysis**: What opt-ins are working for others?
5. **Minimum Viable Test**: Create a simple version, measure signups

**Validation Questions:**
- Would you pay $20 for this? (If no, is it compelling enough for an email?)
- Does this solve an urgent problem?
- Can you explain the benefit in one sentence?
- Is this better than what's freely available?

See `references/validation.md` for the full validation process.

### Step 5: Create the Lead Magnet

**Structure for Success:**

1. **Immediate Value First**: Don't bury the good stuff
2. **Quick Wins Early**: Give them a win in the first section
3. **Clear Next Steps**: What should they do after consuming?
4. **Natural Bridge to Offer**: Connect to your paid solution (softly)

**Design Principles:**
- Professional but not over-designed
- Easy to consume (scannable)
- Branded but not salesy
- Works on mobile

### Step 6: Write the Opt-in Page

The page needs to sell the free thing. Key elements:

**Headline**: The hook, crystallized
**Subhead**: What they'll get/learn/achieve
**Bullet points**: 3-5 specific benefits or contents
**Social proof**: (if available) downloads, testimonials
**Simple form**: Email only (reduce friction)
**CTA button**: Action-oriented text, not "Submit"

## Output Format

When creating a lead magnet plan, deliver:

```
## Lead Magnet Plan: [Name]

### Target Subscriber
[Who this is for and why they'd want it]

### The Hook
[One sentence that makes someone want this]

### Format
[Chosen format and why it fits]

### Validation
[How this was/should be validated]

### Outline
[What the lead magnet will contain]

### Opt-in Page Copy
- Headline: [Text]
- Subhead: [Text]
- Bullets: [3-5 benefits]
- CTA: [Button text]

### Connection to Offer
[How this leads naturally to paid product/service]

### Success Metrics
[How to measure if it's working]
```

## Integration with Other Skills

Lead magnets connect to:
- **positioning-angle**: Use positioning to inform the hook
- **direct-response-copy**: Copy skills apply to opt-in page
- **email-sequences**: Lead magnet triggers welcome sequence
- **keyword-research**: SEO topics suggest magnet ideas

## Common Mistakes

1. **Generic topic**: "Ultimate Guide to Marketing" (yawn)
2. **Too comprehensive**: 50-page ebooks nobody reads
3. **No hook in title**: Needs to promise something specific
4. **Disconnected from offer**: Attracts wrong audience
5. **Over-designed**: Spending 40 hours on design for a checklist
6. **No delivery sequence**: Email arrives, then silence
