## Sequencing Principles

### 1. Foundation First
Always check brand-voice and positioning-angle before heavy execution.

### 2. Strategy Before Tactics
keyword-research and lead-magnet before content creation.

### 3. Creation Before Distribution
Can't repurpose what doesn't exist.

### 4. Conversion After Traffic
Don't optimize sales page until you have traffic to test.

### 5. Iteration Expected
First pass rarely perfect—plan to revisit.

## Abbreviated Sequences

When time is limited:

### Minimum Viable Launch
```
positioning-angle → direct-response-copy → email-sequences (launch only)
```

### Quick Content Start
```
brand-voice → seo-content (skip keyword research if topics known)
```

### Fast List Build
```
lead-magnet → email-sequences (welcome only)
```

**Note:** Abbreviated sequences sacrifice optimization for speed. Plan to fill gaps later.
