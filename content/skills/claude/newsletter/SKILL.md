# Newsletter

Nine formats. From curated to story-driven. Turn content into recurring audience touchpoints.

## Why Newsletters Matter

Your email list is the only audience you own. Social platforms change algorithms, but your subscribers chose to hear from you.

Newsletters turn that permission into:
- Recurring touchpoints
- Trust building
- Traffic generation
- Launch audiences
- Revenue opportunities

## When to Use This Skill

- **Starting Fresh**: Choosing a format for new newsletter
- **Format Switch**: Current format isn't working
- **Edition Planning**: Planning specific newsletter editions
- **Writing**: Creating newsletter content
- **Strategy**: Building newsletter into content system

## The 9 Formats

See `references/9-formats.md` for detailed breakdown of each.

Quick Selection:

| Format | Best For | Effort | Examples |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Curated | Busy professionals | Low | The Hustle, TLDR |
| Educational | Teaching audience | Medium | James Clear, Lenny's |
| Story-Driven | Building connection | Medium | Tim Ferriss, Khe Hy |
| Behind-the-Scenes | Transparency/authenticity | Low | Indie hackers |
| Opinion/POV | Thought leadership | Medium | Stratechery |
| Roundup | Recapping your content | Low | Creator recaps |
| Interview | Leveraging others | High | The Profile |
| Challenge | Driving action | High | 30-day challenges |
| Hybrid | Flexible format | Medium | Most successful ones |

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Choose Your Format

Questions to answer:
- What value can you consistently provide?
- How much time can you dedicate?
- What does your audience need?
- What fits your personality/strengths?

**Format Selection Matrix:**

| If You Have... | Consider... |
|----------------|-------------|
| Strong opinions | Opinion/POV or Story-Driven |
| Lots of content consumption | Curated |
| Teaching expertise | Educational |
| Access to interesting people | Interview |
| Building in public | Behind-the-Scenes |
| Existing content library | Roundup |
| Engaged action-taking audience | Challenge |
| Varied interests | Hybrid |

### Step 2: Define Your Structure

Create a consistent structure your audience can expect.

**Structure Elements:**

```
Subject Line: [Format-appropriate hook]
Preview Text: [Extends curiosity]

Opening: [Hook/transition into content]
  - Personal touch or topical reference
  - 1-3 sentences

Main Content: [The value]
  - Format-specific structure
  - The "meat" of the newsletter

Closing: [Wrap + CTA]
  - Summary or takeaway
  - Call to action (reply, share, link)
  - Personal sign-off
```

### Step 3: Plan Your Edition

**Before Writing:**

1. **Theme/Topic**: What's this edition about?
2. **Hook**: Why should they read this one?
3. **Value**: What will they get from it?
4. **Action**: What do you want them to do?

**Edition Brief:**

```
Edition #: [Number]
Theme: [Topic]
Hook: [Opening angle]
Main Value: [What they'll learn/get]
CTA: [Desired action]
```

### Step 4: Write the Edition

**Apply Brand Voice**
- Load brand-voice profile if available
- Write in your documented voice
- Check for consistency

**Writing Order:**
1. Write the main content first
2. Then write the opening (easier once you know what follows)
3. Then write the subject line (based on strongest hook)
4. Then write the closing/CTA

**Subject Line Formulas:**

| Type | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Curiosity | [Unexpected element] | "The email I almost didn't send" |
| Benefit | [What they'll get] | "3 templates for your next launch" |
| Topical | [Current event + your take] | "What [news] means for your [thing]" |
| Personal | [Direct/intimate] | "A confession about last week" |
| Numbers | [Specific data] | "47% of you said this..." |

### Step 5: Quality Check

**Before Sending:**

- [ ] Subject line is compelling (would you open?)
- [ ] Opening hooks within 2 sentences
- [ ] Value is clear and delivered
- [ ] CTA is specific and actionable
- [ ] Sounds like you (brand voice check)
- [ ] Proofread for errors
- [ ] Links are working
- [ ] Mobile-friendly formatting

## Output Format

When creating newsletter content, deliver:

```
## Newsletter Edition: [Theme/Title]

### Edition Brief
Format: [Which of the 9]
Theme: [Topic]
Hook Angle: [What makes this interesting]
CTA: [Desired reader action]

### Subject Lines (3 Options)
1. [Option 1]
2. [Option 2]
3. [Option 3]

Preview Text: [Text that shows after subject]

### Newsletter Copy

[OPENING]
[Hook + transition - 1-3 sentences]

[MAIN CONTENT]
[Format-specific content]

[CLOSING]
[Wrap + CTA + sign-off]
```

## Consistency & Sustainability

### Batch Creation

To maintain consistency:
- Dedicate specific time for newsletter
- Keep idea capture system
- Batch write when possible
- Build template for each format

### Idea Sources

Where newsletter content comes from:
- Your content (repurpose)
- Industry news (comment on)
- Reader questions (answer)
- Your experiences (share)
- Things you're learning (teach)
- Conversations you're having (summarize)

### When You're Stuck

**Quick Reset Options:**
- Ask a question (engagement edition)
- Share something you learned this week
- Curate 3 best things you consumed
- Answer a reader question
- Share behind-the-scenes of current project

## Integration with Other Skills

Newsletter connects to:
- **brand-voice**: Voice applied to all writing
- **seo-content**: Articles become newsletter topics
- **content-repurposer**: Newsletter content transforms for other platforms
- **positioning-angle**: Newsletter reinforces positioning

## Common Mistakes

1. **No consistent format**: Readers don't know what to expect
2. **All value, no personality**: Informative but forgettable
3. **All personality, no value**: Likable but unsubscribed
4. **Inconsistent sending**: Trust requires reliability
5. **No CTA**: Wasted engagement opportunity
6. **Generic subject lines**: Competition for attention is fierce
7. **Too long**: Respect their time
