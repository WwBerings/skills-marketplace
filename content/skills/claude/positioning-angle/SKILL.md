description: Surface differentiated hooks and unique angles BEFORE writing any marketing copy. Use this skill when launching something new, repositioning existing offers, finding what makes you different, crafting value propositions, or when copy isn't converting because the angle is weak. Contains 8 positioning frameworks to find hooks that make things sell. Triggers on positioning, differentiation, unique angle, value proposition, "why should they buy," competitive advantage, or "what makes us different."

# Positioning Angle

The hook comes before the copy. This skill surfaces differentiated angles using 8 frameworks—so you know WHAT to say before worrying about HOW to say it.

## Why This Matters

Most marketing fails at the positioning layer, not the copy layer. You can write beautiful prose about a weak angle and still lose. But a strong angle with mediocre copy? That sells.

This skill helps you find the angle first.

## When to Use This Skill

- **New Launch**: Find the hook before writing anything
- **Repositioning**: Current angle isn't landing, need fresh perspective  
- **Competitive Pressure**: Competitors crowding your space
- **Conversion Problems**: Good traffic, weak conversion = angle problem
- **Multiple Audiences**: Need different angles for different segments

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Positioning Inputs

Before running frameworks, collect:

**About the Offer:**
- What does it do? (functionality)
- What does it enable? (outcome)
- Who is it for? (specific audience)
- What's the current positioning? (if any)

**About the Market:**
- Who are the main competitors?
- What do they claim?
- Where is the market heading?

**About the Buyer:**
- What problem brings them to you?
- What have they already tried?
- What do they believe about solutions?

### Step 2: Select Framework(s)

Choose 2-3 frameworks based on the situation. See `references/8-frameworks.md` for complete details.

Quick selection guide:

| Situation | Best Frameworks |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Crowded market | Contrarian, Enemy, Category Creation |
| Unknown category | Analogy, Before/After |
| Premium pricing | Outcome, Specificity |
| Complex product | Simplification, Analogy |
| Me-too product | Enemy, Contrarian |

### Step 3: Run Framework Analysis

For each selected framework:
1. Apply the framework's core question
2. Generate 3-5 potential angles
3. Stress-test each angle against criteria

**Angle Evaluation Criteria:**
- Is it true? (Can you prove/demonstrate it?)
- Is it different? (Does anyone else claim this?)
- Is it relevant? (Does the buyer care?)
- Is it specific? (Concrete enough to visualize?)

### Step 4: Extract Hook Candidates

From the framework outputs, pull the strongest angles and articulate them as:

**One-liner version**: Single sentence hook
**Expanded version**: 2-3 sentence positioning statement  
**Proof version**: Hook + evidence that makes it credible

See `references/hook-examples.md` for examples by framework.

### Step 5: Validate Selection

Before committing to an angle:

1. **Competitor Check**: Search the hook language—is anyone else saying it?
2. **Proof Check**: What evidence supports this claim?
3. **Audience Check**: Would target customers care about this specific thing?
4. **Sustainability Check**: Can you own this angle long-term?

## The 8 Frameworks (Overview)

### 1. Contrarian
Question: "What does everyone believe that's actually wrong?"
Power: Positions you as the one who sees what others miss

### 2. Enemy  
Question: "What common approach/tool/belief is holding people back?"
Power: Creates urgency by naming what to move away from

### 3. Before/After
Question: "What transformation do you enable, in specific terms?"
Power: Makes abstract value concrete and visualizable

### 4. Analogy
Question: "What is this the [X] of [Y]?"
Power: Instant understanding through familiar comparison

### 5. Outcome
Question: "What's the ultimate result people actually want?"
Power: Skips features entirely, sells the end state

### 6. Specificity
Question: "What precise, measurable claim can you make?"
Power: Specificity = believability. Vague claims are invisible.

### 7. Category Creation
Question: "What new category could this define?"
Power: Be the only player instead of the better player

### 8. Simplification
Question: "What complexity do you eliminate?"
Power: Positions you as the antidote to overwhelm

See `references/8-frameworks.md` for detailed methodology and examples for each.

## Output Format

After running frameworks, deliver:

```
## Positioning Analysis for [Offer]

### Context
[Brief summary of offer, market, buyer situation]

### Frameworks Applied
[Which 2-3 frameworks were used and why]

### Top Angles Identified

**Angle 1: [Name]**
- One-liner: [Single sentence hook]
- Framework: [Which framework produced this]
- Proof points: [What makes it credible]
- Risk: [Any weakness or caveat]

**Angle 2: [Name]**
[Same structure]

**Angle 3: [Name]**  
[Same structure]

### Recommended Primary Angle
[Which angle to lead with and why]

### Angle Applications
- Headlines: [How this angle becomes headlines]
- Lead magnets: [How to use in opt-in offers]
- Sales pages: [How to structure around this angle]
```

## Integration with Other Skills

Positioning feeds into:
- **direct-response-copy**: Angle becomes the foundation of sales pages
- **lead-magnet**: Angle shapes opt-in offer hooks
- **seo-content**: Angle informs content differentiation
- **email-sequences**: Angle threads through nurture messaging

Always establish positioning BEFORE moving to execution-layer skills.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Picking first decent angle**: Run multiple frameworks, generate options
2. **Choosing clever over clear**: The best angle is understood instantly
3. **Ignoring proof**: Angles without evidence are just claims
4. **Being different for its own sake**: Different must also be relevant
5. **Copying competitor angles**: If they're saying it, find something else
