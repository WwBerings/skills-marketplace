# 8 Positioning Frameworks

Complete methodology for each framework. Use 2-3 per positioning exercise.

---

## 1. Contrarian Framework

### Core Question
"What does everyone in this market believe that's actually wrong?"

### How It Works
Find the conventional wisdom, then position against it. Not for shock value—because you genuinely see something others miss.

### Process
1. List common beliefs in your market (what "everyone knows")
2. Identify which beliefs you disagree with (and why)
3. Articulate what you believe instead
4. Frame your offer as the embodiment of that alternative belief

### Examples

**Conventional Wisdom**: "You need to post on social media every day to grow"
**Contrarian Position**: "One great piece beats 30 mediocre ones. We help you create content worth sharing, not content calendars."

**Conventional Wisdom**: "Personalization requires expensive technology"
**Contrarian Position**: "The best personalization is a human who remembers. We give you the time back to actually know your customers."

### When to Use
- Market is stuck in outdated practices
- You genuinely have a different approach
- Competitors all sound the same

### Watch Out For
- Don't be contrarian just to be different
- Must be able to prove why the alternative is better
- Avoid alienating people who hold the belief strongly

## 2. Enemy Framework

### Core Question
"What common approach/tool/belief is actively holding your customers back?"

### How It Works
Name the villain. Give people something to rally against. Your offer becomes the weapon against that enemy.

### Process
1. Identify what frustrates your target customers
2. Find the root cause (tool, approach, belief, industry practice)
3. Articulate why this enemy causes harm
4. Position your offer as the solution that defeats this enemy

### Examples

**Enemy**: Complicated marketing tools
**Position**: "We're the anti-HubSpot. One screen. No certifications required."

**Enemy**: Generic AI content
**Position**: "While everyone's publishing robot-written garbage, we help you sound like a human again."

**Enemy**: Hustle culture
**Position**: "Build a business that doesn't require you. Strategy over grind."

### When to Use
- Customers are frustrated with status quo
- Clear villain exists that most would agree on
- Your approach is genuinely different from the enemy

### Watch Out For
- Don't pick an enemy your audience loves
- Be specific—vague enemies don't land
- Must offer real alternative, not just criticism

## 3. Before/After Framework

### Core Question
"What specific transformation do you enable? What's the before state vs. the after state?"

### How It Works
Make the value concrete by painting both pictures vividly. People buy the delta between where they are and where they want to be.

### Process
1. Describe the before state in specific, emotional terms
2. Describe the after state with equal specificity
3. Articulate what changes (external results + internal feelings)
4. Position your offer as the bridge

### Before State Elements
- What are they doing? (behaviors)
- What are they feeling? (emotions)
- What results are they getting? (outcomes)
- What do they believe? (mindset)

### After State Elements
- What do they do differently?
- What do they feel instead?
- What results do they achieve?
- What do they now believe?

### Examples

**Before**: "Spending 4 hours writing a blog post that gets 50 views"
**After**: "30 minutes per post, 5,000+ views each, leads coming in while you sleep"

**Before**: "Dreading the weekly team meeting because nothing ever changes"
**After**: "Team meetings that end with clear decisions and actual progress"

### When to Use
- Transformation is dramatic and visualizable
- Emotional before state is painful
- You have proof of the after state

### Watch Out For
- Avoid vague transformations ("feel better," "get results")
- Before state should resonate instantly
- After state must be believable

## 4. Analogy Framework

### Core Question
"What is this the [X] of [Y]?"

### How It Works
Borrow understanding from something familiar to explain something new. Instant comprehension through comparison.

### Process
1. Identify what's confusing or new about your offer
2. Find a category/product people already understand
3. Map the comparison: what's similar?
4. Test if the analogy creates instant understanding

### Analogy Structures
- "The [Famous Product] of [Your Category]"
- "Like [Familiar Thing], but for [Your Audience]"
- "What [Comparison] did for [Their Market], we do for [Your Market]"

### Examples

**Analogy**: "Canva for video editing"
**Meaning**: Simple, template-based, no expertise required

**Analogy**: "Like having a CFO, but for $200/month"
**Meaning**: High-level financial strategy without the salary

**Analogy**: "The anti-agency. We teach you to fish."
**Meaning**: Build capability, not dependency

### When to Use
- New category that needs explanation
- Complex product that benefits from simplification
- Audience knows the comparison reference

### Watch Out For
- Analogy must be instantly understood by target audience
- Don't compare to something with negative associations
- Be careful borrowing from companies with mixed reputations

## 5. Outcome Framework

### Core Question
"What's the ultimate result your customers actually want? What do they lie awake wanting?"

### How It Works
Skip features and benefits entirely. Go straight to the end state. People don't want your product—they want what life looks like after.

### Process
1. Ask "why" repeatedly until you hit the real desire
2. Articulate the outcome in their language
3. Position your offer as the direct path to that outcome
4. Remove all feature talk from the positioning

### The Why Ladder
- Feature: "We have automated email sequences"
- Benefit: "So you can nurture leads without manual work"
- Outcome: "So you can make money while you sleep"
- Deep Outcome: "So you have freedom and security"

### Examples

**Feature-focused**: "AI-powered writing assistant with templates"
**Outcome-focused**: "Publish content that builds your authority without writing"

**Feature-focused**: "All-in-one project management platform"
**Outcome-focused**: "Know what everyone's working on without asking"

### When to Use
- Features are commoditized (everyone has similar)
- The outcome is highly desirable and emotional
- You can credibly promise the outcome

### Watch Out For
- Outcome must be achievable (don't overpromise)
- Still need proof that your method delivers
- Very aspirational outcomes can feel salesy

## 6. Specificity Framework

### Core Question
"What precise, measurable, concrete claim can you make?"

### How It Works
Vague claims are invisible. Specific claims are memorable and believable. Find the number, the timeline, the exact detail.

### Process
1. List all claims you currently make
2. For each, ask: "Can I make this more specific?"
3. Add numbers, timeframes, percentages, concrete details
4. Test which specifics are most impressive and provable

### Specificity Types
- **Numbers**: "347 companies" beats "hundreds of companies"
- **Time**: "In 14 days" beats "quickly"  
- **Percentage**: "37% higher conversion" beats "better conversion"
- **Process**: "3-step method" beats "simple process"
- **Comparison**: "2x faster than Competitor" beats "faster"

### Examples

**Vague**: "Get more leads"
**Specific**: "Add 50 qualified leads to your pipeline every month"

**Vague**: "Fast results"
**Specific**: "See your first results within 72 hours"

**Vague**: "Used by top companies"
**Specific**: "Trusted by 12 of the Fortune 50"

### When to Use
- You have impressive data to share
- Market is full of vague promises
- You can substantiate the specific claim

### Watch Out For
- Specific claims must be true and provable
- Don't use specificity to hide weak results
- Some specifics are more impressive than others—choose wisely

## 7. Category Creation Framework

### Core Question
"What new category could you define and own?"

### How It Works
Stop competing in existing categories where you're compared to incumbents. Create a new category where you're the default leader.

### Process
1. Identify why existing category labels don't fit you
2. Name what's actually new about your approach
3. Define the new category with clear criteria
4. Position yourself as the obvious leader of this new thing

### Category Creation Elements
- **Name**: What's the new category called?
- **Definition**: What makes something part of this category?
- **Problem**: What problem does this category solve better?
- **Difference**: How is this different from adjacent categories?

### Examples

**Old Category**: "CRM Software"
**New Category**: "Revenue Intelligence Platform" (Gong)

**Old Category**: "Email Marketing"
**New Category**: "Creator Economy Email" (ConvertKit)

**Old Category**: "Project Management"
**New Category**: "Work Operating System" (Monday)

### When to Use
- You're genuinely different from existing solutions
- Existing category has baggage or bias
- You can define and defend the new category

### Watch Out For
- Category must be real (not just marketing speak)
- Requires significant investment to establish
- Only works if you can actually own it

## 8. Simplification Framework

### Core Question  
"What complexity do you eliminate? What overwhelm do you cure?"

### How It Works
Position against complexity itself. In a world of too many options, too many steps, too much to learn—be the simple path.

### Process
1. Map the complexity in your space (tools, steps, decisions)
2. Identify what you eliminate or consolidate
3. Articulate the simplicity in concrete terms
4. Position simplicity as the feature itself

### Simplification Types
- **Tool Consolidation**: "One tool instead of seven"
- **Step Reduction**: "Three steps instead of thirty"
- **Decision Elimination**: "We choose for you"
- **Learning Curve**: "Works without training"
- **Time Savings**: "5 minutes instead of 5 hours"

### Examples

**Complex**: "Build landing pages with our drag-and-drop editor, A/B testing suite, and analytics dashboard"
**Simple**: "Pick a template. Add your words. Publish. Done."

**Complex**: "Comprehensive marketing automation platform"
**Simple**: "One button to send your newsletter"

### When to Use
- Your market is overwhelmed by complexity
- Competitors keep adding features
- Your audience values ease over power

### Watch Out For
- Simplicity can imply lack of capability
- Power users may want complexity
- "Simple" is overused—be specific about what's simplified

## Framework Combinations

Some frameworks pair well together:

**Contrarian + Enemy**: Challenge belief + name the villain
**Before/After + Outcome**: Paint transformation + name the end state
**Analogy + Category Creation**: "Like X but better" → new category
**Specificity + Outcome**: Concrete numbers + emotional result
**Simplification + Enemy**: Easy path + complexity is the villain

Run 2-3 frameworks per positioning exercise for best results.
