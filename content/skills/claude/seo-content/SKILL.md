# SEO Content

Structure for search engines. Voice for people.

## The Core Tension

SEO content has two masters:
1. **Google**: Needs structure, coverage, signals
2. **Readers**: Need value, engagement, humanity

Most SEO content fails by optimizing for one and ignoring the other.

This skill teaches you to satisfy both.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Blog Posts**: Informational content for organic traffic
- **Guides**: Comprehensive resources on topics
- **How-to Articles**: Process-oriented content
- **Comparison Posts**: X vs Y content
- **List Posts**: Curated roundups

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Start with Intent

Before writing anything, understand what the searcher actually wants.

**Search Intent Types:**

| Intent | What They Want | Content Format |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Informational | Learn something | Guide, explainer, how-to |
| Navigational | Find something specific | Direct answer + context |
| Commercial | Compare options | Comparison, reviews, lists |
| Transactional | Do/buy something | Product page, landing page |

**Intent Discovery:**
1. Google the target keyword
2. Analyze top 3-5 results
3. Note: Format, length, angle, depth
4. Match your content to the intent

### Step 2: Create the Content Brief

Before writing, know what you're writing.

See `references/structure.md` for detailed structure guidance.

**Brief Components:**

```
Target Keyword: [primary keyword]
Secondary Keywords: [related terms]
Search Intent: [informational/commercial/etc.]
Target Word Count: [based on competitors]
Content Format: [guide/how-to/list/comparison]

Outline:
H1: [Title - include keyword]
H2: [Section 1]
  - Key points to cover
H2: [Section 2]
  - Key points to cover
[etc.]

Competitor Gaps: [What's missing from existing content]
Unique Angle: [Your differentiator]
```

### Step 3: Structure for Search Engines

**Required Elements:**

**Title (H1)**
- Include primary keyword
- Under 60 characters (ideally)
- Compelling to click

**Meta Description**
- 150-160 characters
- Include keyword naturally
- Clear value proposition

**Headers (H2, H3)**
- Logical hierarchy
- Include secondary keywords where natural
- Scannable/descriptive

**Introduction**
- Hook immediately
- State what they'll learn
- Include keyword in first 100 words

**Body Structure**
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Subheadings every 300 words
- Lists where appropriate
- Images/media to break up text

**Internal Links**
- Link to relevant content
- Anchor text should be descriptive
- 3-5 internal links minimum

### Step 4: Write for Humans

This is where most SEO content fails. After structure is set, write like a human.

See `references/humanizing.md` for detailed guidance.

**Apply Brand Voice**
- Load brand-voice profile if available
- Pass content through voice filter
- Remove generic AI patterns

**Human Writing Markers:**
- Opinions and perspectives
- First-person where appropriate
- Specific examples from experience
- Conversational transitions
- Occasional humor/personality
- Varied sentence structure

**Kill These AI Tells:**
- "In today's digital landscape..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "It's important to note..."
- "Let's dive in..."
- Generic bulleted lists with no personality
- Every section same length
- No opinions on anything

### Step 5: Optimize Without Over-Optimizing

**Do:**
- Include keyword in title, first paragraph, subheadings
- Use keyword variations naturally
- Answer related questions (People Also Ask)
- Cover the topic comprehensively
- Add relevant internal/external links

**Don't:**
- Force keyword where it sounds unnatural
- Keyword stuff
- Write for Google at expense of readability
- Add fluff to hit word count
- Copy competitor structure exactly

**Natural Keyword Integration:**
Read the sentence aloud. If keyword sounds forced, rephrase or remove.

### Step 6: Final Quality Check

**SEO Checklist:**
- [ ] Title includes primary keyword
- [ ] Meta description is compelling
- [ ] Keyword in first 100 words
- [ ] Headers are logical hierarchy
- [ ] Internal links included
- [ ] Images have alt text
- [ ] Content matches search intent
- [ ] Comprehensive coverage

**Human Checklist:**
- [ ] Would I enjoy reading this?
- [ ] Does it sound like a person wrote it?
- [ ] Are there specific examples?
- [ ] Is there a clear perspective/opinion?
- [ ] Is it scannable but still engaging?
- [ ] Does it match brand voice (if applicable)?

## Output Format

When creating SEO content, deliver:

```
## SEO Content: [Title]

### Brief
Target Keyword: [keyword]
Search Intent: [type]
Target Length: [word count]
Unique Angle: [differentiator]

### Meta Data
Title: [H1]
Meta Description: [description]

### Article

[INTRODUCTION]
[Hook + what they'll learn + keyword naturally included]

[H2: Section 1]
[Content with personality, examples, specific advice]

[H2: Section 2]
[Content...]

[etc.]

[CONCLUSION]
[Summary + CTA or next steps]

---
Internal Link Suggestions: [list]
Image Suggestions: [list]
```

## Integration with Other Skills

SEO content connects to:
- **keyword-research**: Topics come from 6 Circles analysis
- **brand-voice**: Voice applied throughout writing
- **positioning-angle**: Angle differentiates content
- **newsletter**: Content feeds newsletter
- **content-repurposer**: Articles become other formats

## Common Mistakes

1. **Writing for Google only**: Ranks but nobody engages
2. **Writing for humans only**: Engaging but doesn't rank
3. **Keyword stuffing**: Obvious and damages readability
4. **Generic voice**: Sounds like every other SEO article
5. **Thin content**: Not comprehensive enough to rank
6. **Bloated content**: Fluff to hit word count
7. **No original perspective**: Just repeating competitors
