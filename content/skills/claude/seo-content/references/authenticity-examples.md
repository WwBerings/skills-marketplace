H2: Why I Still Bet on Email (When Everyone Says It's Dead)

Email marketing is supposedly dead. Been hearing that since 2015.

Yet here I am, generating 40% of revenue from a 3,200-person email list [BRON: eigen revenue data 2024]. My Instagram following is 10x larger and brings in maybe 5% of sales.

Email isn't dead. Most people just do it badly.

Here's the difference: social platforms own your audience. Email is yours. When Instagram changed their algorithm in 2023, my reach dropped 67% overnight [BRON: Meta Analytics]. My email list? Still there, still opening at 28%.

Not saying email is easy. Took me two years to figure out the right frequency (2x/week for my B2B audience—your mileage will vary). And I killed a campaign last month that seemed perfect on paper but bombed with 4% CTR [BRON: ConvertKit analytics December 2024].

But the fundamentals work if you avoid three mistakes:
- Pitching in every email (kills trust faster than bad subject lines)
- Buying lists (deliverability death sentence)
- Writing for "everyone" instead of one specific person

According to Litmus's 2024 State of Email report, segmented campaigns drive 3x higher revenue per send than broadcast emails [BRON: Litmus 2024]. I've seen this play out across 12 client campaigns—it's not just theory.

What actually makes email work? You get to start conversations, not broadcast messages.

## Example 2: How-To Section (Subject Line Writing)

### BEFORE (Robotic - Score: 5/16)

```
H2: How to Write Effective Email Subject Lines

Writing effective email subject lines is important for improving open rates. Follow these best practices to create subject lines that get results:

1. Keep it short (under 50 characters)
2. Use action-oriented language
3. Create a sense of urgency
4. Personalize when possible
5. A/B test different variations
6. Avoid spam trigger words
7. Make it relevant to the content
8. Use numbers when appropriate

Subject lines are the first thing recipients see, so it's important to make them compelling. Testing different approaches will help you understand what works best for your audience.
```

- Experience: 1/4 (mentions testing but no actual results)
- Expertise: 1/4 (basic tips, no "why", no edge cases)
- Authority: 0/4 (no sources, no credentials)
- Trust: 3/4 (reasonable advice, not misleading, but no sources)

**Total: 5/16** - Weak

**Issues:**
- 8-item list with no context or examples
- No explanation of WHY these practices work
- Generic advice found everywhere
- No personal experience or data
- No specifics on "compelling" or "what works"
- No edge cases addressed

### AFTER (Authentic - Score: 13/16)

```
H2: The Subject Line Mistake That Cost Me $12K

I used to obsess over subject line length. Under 50 characters. Always.

Then I tested a 67-character subject line for a webinar promotion: "How we grew MRR 340% in 6 months without paid ads (free workshop Tuesday 2pm EST)". It outperformed my "perfect" 42-character version by 89% [BRON: ConvertKit A/B test, November 2024].

That test cost me—I'd been leaving money on the table for months with my rigid "short = better" rule.

Here's what actually matters:

**Mobile truncation (not arbitrary length)**
Subject lines truncate around 40 characters on mobile, 60-70 on desktop [BRON: Litmus 2024 study]. But truncation isn't always bad. "Your invoice is ready..." works because the preview text completes the thought.

Test I ran: Intentionally truncated subject with strong preview text beat fully visible short subject by 23% [BRON: eigen test December 2024].

**Context over urgency**
"Urgency" advice killed my B2B newsletter. Lines like "Last chance!" dropped opens from 31% to 19% [BRON: ConvertKit analytics Q3 2024]. My audience (SaaS founders) sees through artificial urgency.

What works instead: Specific value. "The pricing page mistake costing you 40% of trials" opened at 34%.

**When rules don't apply**
Cold outreach is different. Longer subject lines (50-60 chars) actually perform better because they pre-qualify intent [BRON: Woodpecker 2024 study]. Your subscriber base? Shorter often wins because they already trust you.

I don't have data for B2C e-commerce lists over 100K—my experience is B2B SaaS, 2K-15K subscribers [SCHATTING - patterns may differ at scale].

The real lesson: Test your context, not best practices.
```

**E-E-A-T Analysis:**
- Experience: 4/4 ($12K mistake, specific test results, personal campaign data)
- Expertise: 4/4 (explains WHY truncation matters, addresses edge cases, compares contexts)
- Authority: 3/4 (cites Litmus + Woodpecker studies, lacks author bio in this section)
- Trust: 2/4 (most claims labeled, acknowledges B2C limitation, could add more context on when advice fails)

**Total: 13/16** - Excellent

**What Changed:**
- Opens with failure story ($12K cost)
- Specific test results: 89% lift, 23% improvement, 34% open rate
- Source labels throughout

- Addresses edge cases: cold outreach vs subscriber list, B2B vs B2C
- Acknowledges limitations: "I don't have data for B2C e-commerce lists over 100K"
- Conversational structure: "Here's what actually matters"
- Paragraph variation: 1-7 sentences
- Only 0 bullet lists (transformed to prose with bold headers)

H2: I Migrated 6 Clients from Mailchimp to ConvertKit (Here's When It Makes Sense)

I don't hate Mailchimp. Used it for 4 years before switching.

But in 2023, I migrated 6 client email programs from Mailchimp to ConvertKit. Not because ConvertKit is "better"—it's not, universally. Because the wrong tool was costing them time and money.

H3: The Migration That Saved 8 Hours Per Week

Client: B2B SaaS company, 8,500 subscribers, complex automation sequences.

**Mailchimp problem:** Building a 12-step nurture sequence took 6 hours of clicking through their automation builder. Every time we needed to add a condition (purchased product X, attended webinar Y), another hour of troubleshooting [BRON: client case study, March 2023].

**ConvertKit result:** Same sequence built in 45 minutes using visual automation. Adding conditions = drag and drop. Team could finally iterate on sequences without hiring a Mailchimp expert [BRON: client feedback, May 2023].

Time saved: 8 hours per month on automation changes alone. At $75/hour, that's $7,200 annually [SCHATTING - based on contractor rates].

**But here's what we lost:** Mailchimp's email template builder is better. ConvertKit's template editor is bare-bones. If you're sending design-heavy newsletters (product showcases, visual stories), Mailchimp wins.

H3: When ConvertKit Is the Wrong Choice

Migrated a e-commerce client back to Mailchimp after 3 months.

Why? Their workflow: send product recommendation emails with dynamic content blocks (bestsellers, recently viewed, abandoned cart). Mailchimp's e-commerce integrations made this automatic. ConvertKit required Zapier workarounds that broke twice [BRON: project notes, August 2024].

According to Litmus's 2024 Email Client Comparison, Mailchimp has 3x more native e-commerce integrations than ConvertKit [BRON: Litmus 2024]. For product-driven emails, this matters.

**The decision framework I use:**

Choose **ConvertKit** if:
- You're a creator/consultant selling digital products or services
- Your sequences are behavior-based (clicked link X → send email Y)
- You value speed over design complexity
- Budget: $300-500/year for 5K subscribers

Choose **Mailchimp** if:
- You're e-commerce with physical products
- You need design-heavy templates (brand consistency matters)
- You want extensive analytics (Mailchimp's reporting is deeper)
- Budget: $200-350/year for 5K subscribers [BRON: pricing as of January 2025]

I haven't tested either platform with lists over 50K subscribers—my experience is 2K-15K range [SCHATTING - economics may change at scale].

H3: The Real Cost (Not Just Pricing)

ConvertKit pricing: $369/year for 5K subscribers
Mailchimp pricing: $276/year for 5K subscribers
[BRON: official pricing pages, January 2025]

But implementation time matters. If Mailchimp costs your team 8 hours/month in complexity, you're paying $7,200 in hidden costs. Suddenly ConvertKit's $93/year premium is a bargain.

## Example 4: Technical Explanation (Email Deliverability)

### BEFORE (Robotic - Score: 4/16)

```
H2: Understanding Email Deliverability

Email deliverability refers to the ability of emails to reach recipients' inboxes. Several factors affect deliverability:

- Sender reputation
- Email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Content quality
- Engagement rates
- List hygiene
- Spam complaints

Improving deliverability requires following best practices and monitoring your metrics regularly. Authentication protocols help verify your identity as a sender.

- Experience: 0/4 (no examples, no personal data)
- Expertise: 0/4 (lists factors but doesn't explain HOW they work)
- Authority: 0/4 (no sources, no validation)
- Trust: 4/4 (accurate list, not misleading)

**Total: 4/16** - Weak

**Issues:**
- Lists factors without explaining mechanisms
- No depth on HOW authentication works
- "Best practices" = meaningless without specifics
- No examples or scenarios
- No data on impact

H2: Why 40% of My Emails Disappeared (And How I Fixed It)

June 2023: Inbox placement dropped from 94% to 52% in one week [BRON: Mailgun deliverability analytics]. 40% of emails just... disappeared. Not spam folder. Silently rejected by servers.

The culprit? I didn't understand how sender reputation actually works.

H3: Sender Reputation Isn't What You Think

I thought: "Send good content, avoid spam words, deliverability handled."

Wrong. Email providers (Gmail, Outlook) assign every sending domain a reputation score (0-100). Below 50? Your emails get blocked before anyone decides if they're spam [BRON: Return Path 2024 study].

**What actually tanked my reputation:**

I added 1,200 subscribers from a conference signup sheet. Seems innocent. But 30% of emails bounced (outdated addresses), and engagement dropped from 28% opens to 11% [BRON: ConvertKit analytics June 2023].

Gmail's algorithm saw: "This sender suddenly has terrible engagement. Probably spam." Reputation score dropped from 87 to 41 in 5 days [BRON: Mailgun sender score tracking].

H3: The Authentication Fix Nobody Explains Clearly

Everyone says "set up SPF and DKIM." Cool. What are those?

**SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**: Tells email servers "these IP addresses are allowed to send email for my domain" [BRON: RFC 7208 standard].

**DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**: Adds a cryptographic signature proving the email actually came from your domain [BRON: RFC 6376 standard].

**DMARC (Domain-based Authentication)**: Tells servers what to do if SPF or DKIM fail [BRON: RFC 7489 standard].

I had SPF set up. Didn't have DKIM. That's like locking your front door but leaving windows open.

Added DKIM authentication in November 2023. Inbox placement recovered from 52% to 89% within 3 weeks [BRON: Mailgun analytics November-December 2023]. Not perfect, but functional.

**The edge case that bit me:** I send through ConvertKit, which uses shared IP addresses. Your sender reputation is partly influenced by other ConvertKit users on the same IP [VERIFICATIE NODIG - ConvertKit won't confirm this directly, based on observed patterns].

For lists under 10K, shared IPs are fine. Above 50K? Consider a dedicated IP where you control the entire reputation [BRON: Mailgun pricing documentation - dedicated IPs start at $79/month].

I don't have experience with dedicated IPs yet—my list is 8,500 subscribers [SCHATTING - may need to revisit at 15K+].

H3: List Hygiene Saved Me $2,400

After the reputation crash, I removed:
- 340 hard bounces (permanent failures)
- 89 consistent non-openers (12+ emails, never opened)
- 12 spam complaints

Result: Engagement jumped from 11% to 24% [BRON: ConvertKit analytics July 2023]. Smaller list, but healthier metrics. Reputation recovered.

Cost avoidance: ConvertKit charges by subscriber count. Removing 441 dead addresses saved $2,400 over 12 months [SCHATTING - based on ConvertKit's $29/month tier differences].

**The mistake:** I should have cleaned the list BEFORE it tanked my reputation. Reactive cleaning took 3 months to fix. Proactive cleaning would have prevented the crash.
```

**E-E-A-T Analysis:**
- Experience: 4/4 (personal reputation crash documented, specific recovery timeline, mistakes shared)
- Expertise: 4/4 (explains HOW SPF/DKIM/DMARC work, addresses shared IP edge case, cost analysis)

H2: How a 9-Page PDF Generated 2,847 Leads (And $127K in Revenue)

Client: B2B SaaS company, 47 employees, selling project management software to construction companies ($299/month average contract) [GEANONIMISEERD - client confidentiality].

Problem (March 2024): Website getting 4,200 monthly visitors, converting 0.8% to email subscribers (34 subscribers/month). Sales team couldn't follow up fast enough on trial signups—no nurture system [BRON: client Google Analytics + CRM data March 2024].

H3: The Lead Magnet That Actually Converted

Created: "The Construction Project Manager's 15-Minute Daily Checklist"
- 9-page PDF
- Addresses #1 pain point: staying organized across 5-12 simultaneous projects
- Deliverable: printable checklist + Notion template version

Why this worked: Talked to 8 existing customers to find the specific pain point [BRON: client interview notes]. Didn't guess. Asked: "What problem did you have the day before you signed up?"

6 out of 8 said: "I was drowning in project details across multiple sites."

**Promotion Strategy (What Actually Moved the Needle)**

April-June 2024 execution:

1. **Website popup (exit-intent):** Added to blog posts about project management
   - Result: 4.2% conversion rate, 312 subscribers in 90 days [BRON: OptinMonster analytics]

2. **LinkedIn organic posts:** Founder shared checklist preview + download link 2x/week
   - Result: 1,847 subscribers in 90 days [BRON: ConvertKit source tracking]

3. **Guest post on ConstructionTech Weekly:** Industry newsletter, 38K subscribers
   - Result: 688 subscribers in 48 hours [BRON: ConvertKit source tracking June 2024]

Total: 2,847 subscribers in 90 days (April-June 2024)

**What I Got Wrong First**

Version 1 of the lead magnet: "Complete Guide to Construction Project Management" (42 pages).

Downloaded by 89 people in 30 days. Converted 2% to paid customers [BRON: ConvertKit + client CRM, March 2024].

Why it failed: Too broad. Required 90 minutes to read. Most downloaded, never opened PDF [SCHATTING - based on email engagement patterns, no direct PDF analytics].

Lesson: Specific + immediately useful beats comprehensive.

H3: The Revenue Impact (What Leadership Actually Cared About)

Email nurture sequence (8 emails over 21 days):
- Email 1: Deliver checklist + welcome
- Email 2-4: Case studies of construction companies using the software
- Email 5: Free trial offer
- Email 6-8: Common objections addressed

Conversion path: Lead magnet subscriber → Free trial → Paid customer

Results (April-June 2024):
- 2,847 leads generated
- 412 started free trial (14.5% conversion) [BRON: client CRM]
- 127 became paying customers (30.8% trial-to-paid) [BRON: client CRM]
- Average contract value: $299/month
- Revenue attributed: 127 customers × $299 × 12 months = $455,796 annual recurring revenue [SCHATTING - assumes 12-month retention, actual retention tracked separately]

Cost to create:
- PDF creation: 8 hours @ $125/hour = $1,000
- Email sequence: 6 hours @ $125/hour = $750
- ConvertKit: $29/month × 3 months = $87
- Total: $1,837

ROI (first 90 days): $127K in attributed revenue / $1,837 cost = 69x [BRON: client revenue reporting June 2024]

**The Context That Matters**

This worked for a B2B SaaS company with:
- Clear ICP (construction project managers)
- $299/month product (high enough LTV to justify nurture investment)
- Founder willing to promote on LinkedIn (distribution channel)

I don't have data on whether this approach works for:
- B2C products under $100
- Industries without active LinkedIn audiences
- Products requiring in-person demos [SCHATTING - patterns may differ significantly]

H3: What Didn't Work (The Honest Part)

Tried 3 promotion channels that flopped:

1. **Facebook ads:** Spent $840, got 23 subscribers ($36.52 per subscriber). Stopped after 2 weeks [BRON: Facebook Ads Manager].

2. **Reddit posts:** Banned from r/construction and r/projectmanagement for self-promotion. Zero subscribers, damaged brand perception [BRON: Reddit moderation messages April 2024].

3. **Cold email outreach:** 500 emails sent, 2% open rate, 0 subscribers. ConvertKit flagged account for spam patterns [BRON: ConvertKit compliance warning].

Lesson: Organic + guest posting worked because we provided value first. Paid acquisition failed because targeting was too broad.

If I were to do this again, I'd skip Facebook ads entirely and invest that $840 in 2-3 more guest posts on industry newsletters.

### AFTER (Authentic - Score: 13/16)

```
H2: Frequently Asked Questions

H3: How often should I send emails without annoying people?

The uncomfortable answer: You're probably not sending enough.

I send 2x/week to my B2B audience (SaaS founders, marketing consultants). My data shows:
- 1x/week: 28% open rate, 4.2% unsubscribe rate [BRON: ConvertKit analytics Q1 2024]
- 2x/week: 26% open rate, 4.7% unsubscribe rate [BRON: ConvertKit analytics Q2 2024]
- 3x/week: 19% open rate, 9.1% unsubscribe rate [BRON: ConvertKit analytics Q3 2024 - tested for 6 weeks then stopped]

The 2x/week pattern won because: slightly lower engagement, but 2x the total email interactions. 26% of 8 emails/month = 2.08 interactions. 28% of 4 emails/month = 1.12 interactions.

**But context matters:**

According to Mailchimp's 2024 Email Benchmark study, frequency tolerance varies dramatically by industry [BRON: Mailchimp 2024]:
- E-commerce: 4-5x/week typical (daily promotions expected)
- B2B services: 1-2x/week (more frequent = spam perception)
- Media/publishing: Daily (subscribers expect it)

I killed a client's daily email experiment in B2B SaaS. Unsubscribes jumped from 3% to 14% in one week [BRON: client case study, anonymized, August 2024]. Their audience wasn't media subscribers—they were busy founders who didn't want daily emails.

**Edge case:** If you're sending purely promotional emails (50%+ of content is selling), reduce frequency. My rule: 80% value, 20% promotion. At that ratio, 2x/week works. If you flip to 50% promotion, dial back to 1x/week [SCHATTING - based on observed patterns across 8 clients, not controlled study].

I don't have data for B2C lists over 100K subscribers or media/publishing industries [SCHATTING - patterns may differ significantly].

H3: What's the best time to send emails? (And why you might be optimizing the wrong thing)

I wasted 3 months A/B testing send times.

Results: Tuesday 10am vs Thursday 2pm vs Saturday 8am = 2% variance in open rates [BRON: ConvertKit A/B tests, July-September 2023]. Statistically insignificant.

Know what created a 40% lift in engagement? Writing subject lines that didn't sound like corporate announcements.

**That said, here's where timing matters:**

Avoid Sunday evenings for B2B. Open rates drop 35% compared to weekday averages [BRON: Mailchimp 2024 study]. Theory: People in work-mode Monday-Friday, ignore work emails on Sunday.

For global audiences, timezone matters more than day-of-week [VERIFICATIE NODIG - no hard data, based on observed patterns with 3 international client lists].

Client case: SaaS company with 40% European, 60% US audience. Sending at 10am EST (4pm CET) meant Europeans received emails at end-of-day (low engagement). Split send times: 9am CET for Europe, 10am EST for US. Overall open rate improved 18% [BRON: client case study, May 2024, anonymized].

**The real lesson:** Send when your content is ready and valuable. Obsessing over Tuesday vs Thursday is procrastination disguised as optimization.

**E-E-A-T Analysis:**
- Experience: 4/4 (personal testing data, client case studies, failures shared)
- Expertise: 3/4 (explains when conventional wisdom fails, addresses context, provides decision frameworks)
- Authority: 3/4 (cites Mailchimp benchmark study, multiple client examples, lacks academic sources)
- Trust: 3/4 (all claims labeled, acknowledges gaps, one edge case needs verification)

**Total: 13/16** - Excellent

**What Changed:**
- Direct answer: "You're probably not sending enough"
- Personal testing data: 1x, 2x, 3x/week with specific open rates and unsubscribe rates
- Source labels: [BRON: ConvertKit analytics Q1-Q3 2024]
- Failure shared: 3-month time optimization that yielded only 2% variance
- Client case study: daily emails killed with 14% unsubscribes
- Authority: Mailchimp 2024 benchmark study cited for industry comparisons
- Edge cases: B2B vs e-commerce vs media, global audiences with timezones
- Acknowledges limitations: "I don't have data for B2C lists over 100K"
- Contrarian take: "Timing matters less than you think"
- Paragraph variation: 1-7 sentences
- Strategic list use: 1 bulleted list (testing results), rest is prose

## Key Patterns Across All Examples

### Experience Signals
- Personal failures shared openly
- Specific metrics with timelines
- Client case studies (anonymized when needed)
- "I tested this" vs "experts recommend"

### Expertise Signals
- Explains WHY behind recommendations
- Addresses edge cases and context
- Compares trade-offs between approaches
- Contradicts conventional wisdom with data

### Authority Signals
- Cites credible sources with [BRON] labels
- References industry studies (Litmus, Mailchimp, Return Path)
- Multiple client examples (not just one anecdote)
- Technical standards cited where relevant (RFC documents)

### Trust Signals
- All claims labeled: [BRON], [SCHATTING], [VERIFICATIE NODIG], [GEANONIMISEERD]
- Acknowledges knowledge gaps and limitations
- Transparent about what didn't work
- Clear context boundaries ("B2B SaaS, not B2C e-commerce")

### Structural Authenticity
- Paragraph variation (1-10 sentences)
- Minimal lists (0-3 per example)
- Conversational transitions ("But here's the thing...", "The uncomfortable answer:")
- Section lengths vary naturally (not all uniform)
- Bold headers for scannable structure without bullet overuse
